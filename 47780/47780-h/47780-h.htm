The Story of the Crusades

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
The Story of Mohammed the Prophet
</h3>

<p class="intro">
<i>A poor shepherd people roaming unnoticed in the deserts of Arabia: a
Hero-Prophet sent down to them with a word they could believe: See! the
unnoticed becomes world-notable, the small has grown world-great</i>.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CARLYLE: <i>Hero as Prophet</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The two hundred years which cover, roughly
speaking, the actual period of the Holy War, are
crammed with an interest that never grows dim.
Gallant figures, noble knights, generous foes, valiant
women, eager children, follow one another through these
centuries, and form a pageant the colour and romance
of which can never fade, for the circumstances were in
themselves unique.  The two great religious forces of
the world&mdash;Christianity and Islam, the Cross and the
Crescent&mdash;were at grips with one another, and for the
first time the stately East, with its suggestion of mystery,
was face to face with the brilliant West, wherein the
civilisation and organisation of Rome were at last
prevailing over the chaos of the Dark Ages.
</p>

<p>
A very special kind of interest, moreover, belongs to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
the story of the Crusades in that the motive of the wars
was the desire to rescue from the hands of unbelievers
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Those holy fields<br />
  Over whose acres walked those blessed feet<br />
  Which, fourteen hundred year before, were nailed<br />
  For our advantage on the bitter cross.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But we shall see, as we read the story, that this was
only a part of the real motive power which inspired and
sustained the Holy War.
</p>

<p>
Even if the land of Palestine and the Holy City,
Jerusalem, had never fallen into the hands of the
Saracens, some such war was inevitable.  The East
was knocking at the doors of the West with no uncertain
sound.  An extraordinary force had come into existence
during the four centuries that immediately preceded the
First Crusade, which threatened to dominate the whole of
the Western world.  It was a religious force&mdash;always
stronger and more effective than any other; and it was
only repelled with the greatest difficulty by Christendom,
inspired, not so much by the motive of religion, as
by that curious mixture of romance and adventurous
design which we call chivalry.
</p>

<p>
Let us try, then, first of all, to get some idea of these
Men of the East, the Mohammedans or Saracens, who
managed to keep Europe in a state of constant turmoil for
upwards of five centuries, and to do that we must go back
to the latter years of the sixth century after Christ.
</p>

<p>
About fifty miles from the shores of the Red Sea
stands the city of Mecca, one of the few important towns
to be found on the fringe of the great sandy desert of
Arabia.  During hundreds of years Mecca had been the
venerated bourne of pilgrims, for, embedded in the walls
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
of the sacred building known as the Kaaba, was the
"pure white stone," said to have fallen from heaven on
the day that Adam and Eve took their sorrowful way
from the gates of Paradise.
</p>

<p>
The Arabs, or Saracens, of these early days were closely
connected with their neighbours, the Jews of Palestine,
and claimed the same descent from Abraham through
Ishmael, the outcast son.  They believed in the existence
of God, whom, to some extent, they worshipped, under
the name of Allah.  But they were deeply interested in
nature-worship: the sun, moon, and stars were their
deities.  They bowed down before the "pure white
stone" in the Kaaba, now from its frequent handling
rather black than white.  They peopled the whole
realm of nature&mdash;oceans, rivers, mountains, caves&mdash;with
spirits good and evil, called "jinns" or genii, made, not
of clay, like mortal men, but of pure flame of fire.
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time these jinns were said to have lived
in heaven, and to have worshipped the Lord of Hosts;
but having rebelled, under the leadership of Iblis, against
Allah, they were cast forth, and descended to the earth,
where they became sometimes a pest and annoyance to
men, and sometimes their servants.
</p>

<p>
Many legends concerning these spirits are to be found
in the Koran, the sacred book of the Mohammedans.
One of these tells how the jinns were wont to roam round
about the gates of heaven, peeping and listening and
catching here and there a little of the converse of the
angels.  But these were only isolated words, or
disjointed phrases; and the mischievous jinns, hoping that
evil would come of these odds and ends of conversation
separated from their context, whispered them
industriously in the ears of the sons of men.  These the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
latter, always eager to know more of the Unseen World,
readily accepted, and invariably put a wrong interpretation
upon them.  Hence arose superstition, black magic,
false prophecies, evil omens, and all such things as had in
them the germ of truth, but had been misunderstood and
misapplied.
</p>

<p>
From the midst of this imaginative and nature-worshipping
people there arose the prophet who was to found
one of the most powerful religious sects in the world.
</p>

<p>
In the year 570 A.D., in the city of Mecca, a boy
child came to the young mother Amina, to comfort
her in her widowhood for the husband who had died
a few weeks before.  Tradition has been active
regarding the cradle of this child, the young Mohammed.
He is said to have exclaimed at the moment of birth,
"Allah is great!  There is no God but Allah, and I
am His prophet."
</p>

<p>
That same day an earthquake was reported to have
overturned the gorgeous palace of Persia; a wild camel
was seen in a vision to be overthrown by a slender Arab
horse; and Iblis, the evil spirit, leader of the malignant
jinns, was cast into the depths of ocean.
</p>

<p>
What is actually known about the matter is that the
babe was presented to his tribe on the seventh day after
his birth, and was named Mohammed, the "Praised One,"
in prophetic allusion to his future fame.
</p>

<p>
For the first five years of his life, according to Arabian
custom, the child was sent to a foster-mother in the
mountains that he might grow up sturdy and healthy.
Soon after the end of that period, his mother died, and
he was left to the care of his uncle, Abu Talib, a wealthy
trader, who was so fond and proud of his nephew that he
let the boy accompany him on many of his long caravan
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
journeys to Yemen or Syria.  Thus the young
Mohammed became intimately acquainted with all sorts
and conditions of men.  He had no books, but he was an
eager listener to the poems recited by the bards in the
market-place of each great town.  He quickly absorbed
the legends and superstitions of his country, formed his
own opinion about the idol-worship practised by many
of the Arab tribes, and was present on a great historic
occasion, when an oath was taken by his tribe in alliance
with others, to be the champions of the weak and the
avengers of the oppressed.  Moreover, since his own
home was at Mecca, the "Fair of all Arabia," the centre
of trade for India, Syria, Egypt, and Italy, the boy had
plenty of chances of acquiring that knowledge of the
world which subsequently served him in good stead as a
leader of men.
</p>

<p>
He grew up a silent, thoughtful youth, loved and
respected by his companions, who named him El Amin,
the "Faithful One."  He was notable too for his good
looks, for his bright dark eyes, clear brown skin, and for
a curious black vein that swelled between his eyebrows
when he was moved to anger.  He had wide opportunities
for thought and meditation, since, as was the case with
most Arabs, his occupation was for years that of a
shepherd on the hillsides of his native city.  Eventually,
at his uncle's wish, he became camel-driver and
conductor of the caravan of a certain rich widow named
Kadija.  The long journey to Syria was undertaken with
success, and on his return the widow Kadija looked upon
the young man of twenty-five with eyes of favour.  She
imagined she saw two angels shielding him with their
wings from the scorching sunshine, and, taking this for an
indication that he was under the special protection of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
Allah, sent her sister to him, according to a common
custom of Arabia, to intimate her willingness to be his
bride.
</p>

<p>
So the poor camel-driver became the husband of the
wealthy Kadija, and a very happy marriage it turned
out to be.  Six children came to gladden the peaceful
home, of whom the youngest, Fatima, was to play a part
in future history.  To all appearances these were years
of calm existence, almost of stagnation, for Mohammed;
but all the time the inner life of the man was growing,
expanding, throwing out fresh tentacles of thought and
inquiry, as he brooded upon the condition, and especially
upon the religious condition, of his fellow-countrymen.
For the Arabs of his day were a degenerate race, much
given to drinking and gaming and evil passions.  They
thought nothing of burying their girl-children alive after
birth, as unworthy to be brought up.  They had no
heroic ideals, and their religion was becoming more and
more vague and shadowy where it was not given over
entirely to the worship of idols.
</p>

<p>
It was the Arab custom to keep the month Ramadan
as a kind of Lent, in fasting, in seclusion and meditation;
and Mohammed, during that period, was wont to retire to
a cave in a mountain near Mecca, sometimes with
Kadija, sometimes quite alone.  There he was overtaken
on one occasion by strange trances and visions in which
uttered weird prophetic sentences.  He subsequently
confided to Kadija, who was with him at that time, that
he had made the Great Discovery; that all these idols,
and sacred stones, and empty phrases of religion were
nothing&mdash;nothing at all.  "That God is great, and that
there is nothing else great.  He is Reality.  Wooden
idols are not real; but He is real&mdash;He made us and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
protects us; hence <i>We must submit to Allah, and strive
after righteousness</i>."  This was to be the keynote of the
faith to be known as <i>Islam</i>.
</p>

<p>
After this revelation had come to him, Mohammed
continued his life of thought and meditation for some
time, until he was nearly forty years of age.  He may
have spoken of his conviction to his friends, but he does
not seem to have gained much sympathy, and rather he
appears to have earned the reputation of a dreamer.
But about the year 610, as he was wandering over the
wild hillsides, the clear call came, as it is bound to come
to the humble, listening soul.  He had lain down to sleep
when, in a vision, he heard three times his name
repeated, and the third time saw the angel Gabriel&mdash;in
whose existence both Arabs and Jews believed&mdash;who
spoke to him and bade him
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Cry! in the name of Allah!<br />
  In the name of Allah,<br />
  Who hath created man.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At first Mohammed was much disturbed by this
message, which he did not clearly understand.  He
feared he was under the influence of magic, and was filled
with dread of falling into the hands of jinns.  After a
visit to his home, he again sought the mountain, intending
in his harassed state of mind to put an end to his life.
Each time he attempted this, something restrained him,
and as he sat at length in despair upon the ground
wrapped in his cloak, the angel once more appeared,
saying&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>O thou that art covered,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arise and preach,<br />
  And magnify Allah!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purify thy garments,</i><br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Shun all evils,<br />
  Grant not money on usury,<br />
  Wait patiently for Allah.<br />
  When the trump shall blow shall be distress for unbelievers.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
From that time the vocation of Mohammed was clear.
He was to go forth and preach to a nation of idolaters
that there was one God, and only one, who might claim
their worship.  Never again did he hesitate, nor, on the
other hand, did he begin his work in haste.  He still
sojourned among the mountains, where he was visited
by his uncle, Abu Talib, and by the little son of the
latter, a boy called Ali.
</p>

<p>
"What calls you here, Mohammed?" asked the
puzzled Abu, "and what religion do you now profess?"
</p>

<p>
Said Mohammed: "I profess the religion of Allah, of
His angels and His prophets, the religion of Abraham.
Allah has commissioned me to preach this to men, and
to urge them to embrace it.  Nought would be more
worthy of thee, O my uncle, than to adopt the true faith,
and to help me to spread it."
</p>

<p>
But Abu Talib replied: "Son of my brother, I can
never forsake the faith of my fathers; but if thou art
attacked, I will defend thee."  Then to his young son
Ali he continued: "Hesitate not to follow any advice he
giveth thee, for Mohammed will never lead thee into any
wrong way."
</p>

<p>
The first attempts of Mohammed to begin his work
of conversion met with small success.  We have good
authority for the proverb that "a prophet has no
honour in his own country," and in Mohammed's case
his task was made supremely difficult by the fact that
Mecca would no longer be the goal of thousands of pilgrims
every year if the Arabs were to give up the worship
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
of the idols of the Kaaba, which numbered, exclusive of
the "pure white stone" itself, some three hundred and
sixty-five images.  Now the whole prosperity of the city
depended upon the caravan trade brought by these
pilgrims, as well as on the profits made out of providing
food and shelter for such vast numbers.  Realising this,
Mohammed made no attempt at a public proclamation of
the new faith for the first three years, but contented
himself with training two or three converts to be his
helpers in the future.
</p>

<p>
His faithful wife Kadija was with him heart and soul,
and to her, first of all, he disclosed the details which the
angel had revealed to him in a vision, as to the particular
acts of ritual, forms of prayer, and actual doctrine which
<i>Islam</i>, as their faith was called, demanded of its followers.
The essential fact of this religion was a belief in Allah as
the one true God, in a future life of happiness or misery
after death, and in Mohammed himself as the Prophet
of Allah, whom they were bound to obey.  It was
essentially a practical faith, however, and, in addition to
prayer five times a day, the Islamite or <i>Moslem</i> must
give alms to the poor, be perfectly honest in weighing
and measuring, be absolutely truthful, and keep strictly
to all agreements made.  Many minor details were
afterwards added to these, and the whole were gradually
written down in the <i>Koran</i>, the sacred book of Islam.
This, of course, was not done till many years later, when
Mohammed had drawn up a moral and social code which
he hoped would reform the whole world.  In the
meantime he had a hard struggle before him.
</p>

<p>
One of his first followers was the child Ali, who,
though but eleven years old, became his constant
companion in his lonely rambles, and eagerly received his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
instructions.  A freed slave, and Abu Bekr, a man of
official rank, enthusiastic for the new faith, were his
next converts.  In vain did Mohammed call together
the members of his tribe, saying unto them&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Never has an Arab offered to his people such
precious things as I now present to you&mdash;happiness in
this life, and joys for ever in the next.  Allah has bidden
me call men to Him&mdash;Who will join me in the sacred
work and become my brother?"
</p>

<p>
Deep silence followed this appeal, broken only by the
high, childish voice of little Ali, who cried out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I, Prophet of Allah, I will join you!"
</p>

<p>
Quite seriously Mohammed received the offer, saying
to the assembled throng, "Behold my brother, my
<i>Kalif</i>!  Listen to him.  Obey his commands."
</p>

<p>
Soon after this appeal to his own tribe, a spirit of
active opposition arose among the men of Mecca, so much
so that the chief men came to Abu Talib and warned him
that if he did not prevail upon Mohammed to hold his
peace and give up these new doctrines, they would take
up arms against him and his supporters.  Much alarmed
at this protest, Abu Talib implored his nephew to keep
his new-formed faith to himself.  But Mohammed
answered, "O my uncle, even if the sun should
descend on my right hand and the moon on my left to
fight against me, ordering me to hold my peace or
perish, I would not waver from my purpose."
</p>

<p>
Then, thinking that the friend he loved so well was
about to desert him, he turned away and wept.  But the
old Abu, touched to the heart, cried out, "Come back,
O my nephew!  Preach whatever doctrine thou wilt.
I swear to thee that not for a moment will I desert thy
side."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
</p>

<p>
Opposition soon took the form of misrepresentation.
The enemies of Mohammed would lie in wait for the
pilgrims going up to the Kaaba and warn them to
beware of a dangerous magician, whose charms sowed
discord in the household, dividing husband and wife,
parent and child.  But this had the natural effect of
making strangers much more curious about Mohammed
than they would otherwise have been.  They made their
own inquiries, and though few converts were the result,
the reputation of the Prophet, in a more or less misleading
form, was gradually spread by them throughout the
length and breadth of Arabia.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, Mohammed himself was the object of open
insult in the streets of Mecca, as well as of actual
violence.  One effect of this, however, was to bring over
to his side another uncle, Hamza by name who had been
one of his fiercest opponents.  Hearing of some new
outrage, he hastened to the Kaaba and stood forth
openly as the champion of the Prophet.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> am of the new religion!  Return <i>that</i>, if you dare!"
he cried, dealing a vigorous blow at one of the angry
and astonished assembly.  They drew back in awe,
and Hamza, the "Lion of Allah," became one of the
most ardent followers of Islam.
</p>

<p>
The tide of persecution, however, was not stayed, and
at length Mohammed, unable to protect his followers
from the violence he was willing to endure himself,
persuaded them to take refuge in Abyssinia, under
the protection of the Christian king.
</p>

<p>
Furious at this, the men of Mecca placed Mohammed
and his whole family under a ban for three long years,
during which the Faithful nearly perished of hunger,
for no man might buy of them or sell to them or have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
any kind of intercourse with them.  This ban was
removed at the end of three years, but then a worse
blow fell upon the Prophet.  Kadija, his faithful, loving
wife, and Abu Talib, his friend and protector, both
died.  The death of Abu led to a renewal of persecution;
very few fresh converts were made; failure met him
on every side.  The only ray of light in this period of
gloom was the discovery that twelve pilgrims journeying
from the distant city of Medina had already become
followers of Islam from what they had heard of the new
faith as taught by Mohammed.  These men he gladly
instructed more fully, and sent them back as missionaries
to their own city.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of his depression and disheartened
forebodings for the future, Mohammed was vouchsafed
a marvellous vision or dream.
</p>

<p>
"Awake, thou that sleepest!" cried a voice like a
silver trumpet, and there appeared to him an angel
of wonderful brightness, who bade him mount the
winged steed, <i>Borak</i>, the Lightning, and ascend to
the Temple at Jerusalem.  Thence by a ladder of light,
Mohammed rose to the first heaven, made of pure silver,
and lighted by stars suspended by chains of gold.  There
he was embraced as the chief of prophets by Adam,
the first created man.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-021"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-021.jpg" alt="The Vision of Mohammed" />
<br />
<i>The Vision of Mohammed</i>
</p>

<p>
Thence he proceeded to the second heaven, which was
of steel, and there he was greeted by Noah.  The third
heaven, where Joseph met him, was brilliant with
precious stones.  There too sat the Angel of Death,
writing down the names of all who were to be born,
and blotting out the names of those whose time had come
to die.  In the fourth heaven Aaron showed to him
the Angel of Vengeance, in whose hands was a fiery
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
spear.  In the fifth Moses spoke with him and wept to
see one who was going to lead to Paradise more of the
Chosen People than he, their prophet.  In the sixth,
of marvellous brightness, Abraham occupied chief
place; and Mohammed was even allowed to penetrate
further to the seventh heaven, where Allah, His glory
veiled, gave him instructions as to the doctrines of
Islam, and bade him command his followers to utter
fifty prayers a day.
</p>

<p>
When the Prophet returned to Moses, the latter
pointed out that the number was too much to expect
of Arabs, and bade him ask Allah to reduce it.  In
answer to his supplications, Allah said at first that
forty prayers would be satisfactory, but Mohammed
pleaded earnestly for further relief, and at last the
number was fixed at five, at which it remains to this
day.  "Allahu akbar&mdash;Prayer is better than sleep!
There is no God but Allah!  He giveth life and He dieth
not!  O thou bountiful!  Thy mercy ceaseth not!
My sins are great, greater is Thy mercy!  I praise His
perfection!  Allahu akbar!"
</p>

<p>
Still, five times a day, the peculiar cry of the "mullah"
is heard from the tower of prayer, giving the
signal for the follower of Islam to turn towards Mecca,
throw himself on his face, and utter the prescribed
words.
</p>

<p>
Much inspired by this wonderful dream, Mohammed
was further encouraged by the news that seventy men
of Medina had joined the ranks of Islam and were about
to meet him on the hillside beyond Mecca, with intent
to induce him, if possible, to take up his future abode
in their city, leaving his birthplace to its fate.  There,
under the dark midnight sky, these men bound
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
themselves to worship Allah only, to obey the Prophet, and
to fight in defence of him and his followers.
</p>

<p>
"And what will be our reward?" asked one.
</p>

<p>
"Paradise!" replied Mohammed briefly.
</p>

<p>
And then the oath was sworn; while the Prophet,
on his side, promised to live and die with his new converts
when the time was ripe.
</p>

<p>
The meeting had, however, been watched by spies,
who reported all to the men of Mecca; and a new persecution
arose, so bitter that most of the "Faithful," as
the followers of Mohammed came to be called, fled
at once to Medina.  Mohammed himself remained,
hoping that thus he might turn the wrath of the idolaters
upon himself and protect the flight of his children.
</p>

<p>
Presently, however, came information that forty
men, one from each tribe, had sworn together to take
his life; and forthwith Mohammed with Abu Bekr,
his devoted friend, departed one dark night and shook
off the dust of Mecca from his feet.  Danger was so
near that they dared not take the path to Medina,
but made their way to a mountain, on whose rocky
summit they found a small cave into which they crept
at dawn of day.
</p>

<p>
Knowing what the end of the pursuit would mean,
Abu began to lose nerve, and asked, "What if our
pursuers should find our cave?  We are but two."
</p>

<p>
"We are three," was the calm reply: "Allah is with us!"
</p>

<p>
Legend says that the pursuers actually approached
the mouth of the cave and were about to investigate
it.  But in the early hours of the day Allah had caused
a tree to grow up before it, a spider to weave its web
across it, and a wild pigeon, most timid of birds, to lay
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
eggs in a nest made in the branches; and the searchers,
seeing these things, declared it impossible that any
one could be within.  A faithful friend provided them
in secret with food and milk, and on the third night
they began the journey to Medina.
</p>

<p>
"He is come!  He is come!" cried the Faithful
in Medina, flocking to meet the wayworn travellers
as they entered the city.
</p>

<p>
And thus a new chapter was opened in the history
of Islam.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
Mohammed as Conqueror
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>He is come to ope<br />
  The purple testament of bleeding war.</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHAKESPEARE: <i>Richard II.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The year which marked Mohammed's triumphant
entry into Medina is known in the Mohammedan
world as the <i>Hegira</i>, and counts as the Year
One in their calendar&mdash;the year from which all others
are reckoned.  For the first time the faith of Islam
was preached openly, and the claim of Mohammed
to be merely <i>one</i> of the "prophets" gave place to a
demand for acknowledgment as the chief of all, a
demand calculated to arouse the antagonism of all
other existing forms of religion.  The other important
development of his teaching at this time was that all
faithful Moslems&mdash;the followers of the Prophet&mdash;must
entirely abstain from the use of intoxicating drink.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, though at first Mohammed (possibly to please
the Jews in Medina) had commanded that at the hour
of prayer every Moslem should turn his face towards
Jerusalem, in course of time, when he began to see
the impossibility of uniting the Jewish believers with
those of Islam, he suddenly, after the usual prostration,
turned towards the Temple at Mecca.  From that
moment down to the present day the Moslem, wherever
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
he is, follows this example at the fivefold hour of
prayer.
</p>

<p>
At Medina, Mohammed married the young girl Ayesha,
and, as permitted by the Moslem faith, soon brought
other wives to the simply built house by the mosque
which he and his converts were building just outside
the city.  Yet, though a man of fifty-three, the Prophet
by no means intended to pass the rest of his life in ease
and domestic comfort.  He had been forced by violence
to flee from Mecca.  He now conceived it his duty to
make himself master of his native city by means of the
sword.
</p>

<p>
The sons of the desert are born fighters, and whether
his motive was to enforce the Moslem faith at the peril
of the sword, or merely to assert his personal rights,
the fact remains that he had no difficulty whatever
in rallying to his standard a small though most
enthusiastic army.
</p>

<p>
An attempt to seize a rich caravan belonging to a
merchant of Mecca was the signal for battle.  The
forces of Mecca, hastily gathered, went out against
the Moslem host, and, after hard fighting, were dispersed.
There was joy in Medina when the "swift dromedary"
of the Prophet appeared at the house of prayer and
the news was made known; but in Mecca was bitter
hatred and woe, fitly expressed in the grim words of
the wife of the slain leader of the caravan: "Not
till ye again wage war against Mohammed and his
fellows shall tears flow from my eyes!  If tears would
wash away grief, I would now weep, even as ye; but
with me it is not so!"
</p>

<p>
From that time Mohammed gave up all pretence
of winning converts by peaceable methods;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
henceforth he was to live and die a man of the sword.
Deterioration of character was a more or less natural
outcome of this change.  It may have been necessary
to invent visions in order to convince the ignorant
people of Medina that their victory was due, not to
their own strength, but to the aid of the angels of
Allah, who would always fight upon their side; but
we cannot say the same of the applause, given openly
by Mohammed in the mosque, to the cold-blooded
murderer of a woman who had composed some verses
throwing doubt upon the right of the Prophet to glory
in the death of the men of his own tribe.  Nor was
this the only instance of revenge and cruelty.  It was
but too clear that Mohammed, from a calm and peaceful
prophet, had been transformed into a warlike chieftain,
bent on subduing all others to his will.  When Mecca
declared battle, he went out to the field, clad in full
armour, sword in hand.  At first all went well with
the Moslems.  Then Mohammed was struck in the
mouth and cheek, and a cry went up, "The Prophet is
slain!  Where is now the promise of Allah?"  Their
cry was drowned in the triumphant shouts of the men
of Mecca, "War hath its revenge; Allah is for
us&mdash;not for you!"
</p>

<p>
The day was lost; and it needed all the Prophet's
ingenuity to account for it satisfactorily to those whom
he had so often assured of the certain protection of
Allah.  From that time possibly dates the belief of
the Moslems that he who dies in battle against the
unbeliever is so certain of the joys of Paradise that it
is the survivor rather than the slain who should be
pitied.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, before the contest with Mecca could be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
finally settled, Mohammed undertook to crush, once
for all, the Jewish power in Arabia.  It seems strange
that there should have been such hostility between
Jews and Moslems, seeing that both claimed the God
of Abraham as the object of their worship; but this
was now lost sight of in view of the natural refusal
of the former to acknowledge Mohammed as the chief
of all prophets, and his sacred book, the Koran, as
superior to their "Book of the Law," the Old
Testament.  By dint of persecuting those who dwelt within
the walls of Medina, and of besieging their cities
elsewhere, Mohammed compelled the Jews to migrate to
Syria, leaving their abandoned lands and cities to him.
The event finds special mention in the Koran.
</p>

<p>
"Allah it is who drove out the People of the Book,
<i>(the Jews</i>), who believed not, to join the former exiles.
Ye thought not they would go forth; verily, <i>they</i> thought
that their fortresses would defend them against Allah;
but Allah came upon them from a quarter unexpected
and covered their hearts with dread."
</p>

<p>
Soon after this event, Ali, his faithful nephew, was
still more closely united with Mohammed by his marriage
with Fatima, the Prophet's daughter; and thus he of
whom Mohammed was wont to say, "I am the city
of wisdom, but Ali is its door," was joined to one of
the "four perfect women" spoken of by the Prophet.
</p>

<p>
It was now six years since Mohammed had left Mecca,
during which time he had never ceased to yearn and
plan for his triumphant return.  The Kaaba, save for
its idols, was sacred to him as the home of the worship
of Allah, and his heart was bitter within him when he
reflected that he and his followers had been so long
forbidden the yearly pilgrimage thither.  So he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
determined to put the temper of the Meccans to the test by
making a pilgrimage, with a sufficient number of
followers to resist any aggressive act of hostility.  As
they approached the sacred borders, the camel of
Mohammed refused to go further.  "The creature is
obstinate and weary," said the Moslems.  "Not so,"
answered Mohammed, "the hand of Allah restrains
her.  If the Meccans make any demand of me this day,
I will grant it.  Let the caravan halt."  "There is
no water here," they cried in dismay, "how shall we
halt?"  But Mohammed ordered that a dried-up well
should be opened, and at once water bubbled up to the
surface.
</p>

<p>
Still more surprised were the Moslems, all of whom were
burning to fight, when they found the Prophet quietly
accepting the terms offered by the men of Mecca, when
they promised to permit future pilgrimages, though they
would not allow him to enter the city on that occasion.
</p>

<p>
Once recognised by his own birthplace, Mohammed
determined to bring about his most ambitious project,
and to summon all the kingdoms of the earth to
acknowledge Islam.
</p>

<p>
He even had a signet-ring engraved with the words
"Mohammed, the Apostle of Allah," and, in a spirit
of sublime self-confidence, sent it to the King of Persia,
to the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, and to the rulers
of Syria, Abyssinia, and Egypt.  Nothing came of it,
of course, and meantime the earlier desire of his heart
had been gratified.  The pilgrimage to Mecca had been
undertaken in safety, and the Prophet had worshipped
after the manner of Islam within the very walls of the
sacred Kaaba.
</p>

<p>
That same year saw the Moslems on the march against
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
the forces of Rome herself.  One of the Prophet's
envoys had been put to death by the Christian chieftain
of a Syrian tribe, which was under Roman rule; and
the little Moslem army at once set out from Medina to
avenge him.  Little did Mohammed know of the Roman
military power when he sent forth his men with such
high words of courage.  The Moslem troops advanced,
crying "Paradise! how fair is thy resting-place!
Cold is the water there and sweet the shade!  Rome!
Rome!  The hour of thy woe draweth nigh!  When
we close with her, we shall hurl her to the dust."
</p>

<p>
Instead of this, a discomfited rabble made their way
back to Medina in hot haste, to be received with cries
of "Oh, runaways!  Do ye indeed flee before the enemy
when fighting for Allah?"
</p>

<p>
Nor did the conquest of several wandering desert
tribes soothe the wounded pride of the Prophet.  He
could only be consoled by his next project of making
himself master of Mecca, the Holy City, itself.  He
was strong enough now to put ten thousand of his
followers in the field, and with these, after a rapid and
secret march, he encamped on the hills above the city,
where his ten thousand twinkling watch-fires could
strike terror into the hearts of the inhabitants.  That
night a chieftain of the men of Mecca, going forth
in the darkness to reconnoitre the enemy, was captured
and brought before the Prophet.  Threatened with
death, he agreed to embrace the faith of Islam, and was
forthwith sent back to his city with this message:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Every Meccan who is found in thy dwelling; all
who take refuge in the Kaaba; and whosoever shutteth
the door of his own house upon his family, shall be
safe: haste thee home!"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
</p>

<p>
The army followed hard upon his heels, fearing
treachery; but the new-made convert kept faith;
and when they entered Mecca, it was like a city of the
dead.
</p>

<p>
The first act of Mohammed was to destroy the idols
in the Kaaba, and to sound the call for prayer from
its summit.  But except in the case of a few rebellious
spirits, no blood was shed, and no cruelty shown to
those who had once been his persecutors.  The chiefs
of the Meccans indeed came before him, fearing the
worst; and of them he asked, "What can you expect
at my hands?"
</p>

<p>
"Mercy, O generous brother," they answered.
</p>

<p>
"Be it so; ye are free!" was the Prophet's reply.
</p>

<p>
"Thus, after an exile of seven years, the fugitive
missionary was enthroned as the Prince and Prophet
of his native country."[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap02fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap02fn1text">1</a>] Gibbon.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the years that followed his triumphant possession
of Mecca, all the tribes and cities from the Euphrates
to the head of the Red Sea submitted to Mohammed,
who thus became the founder of a new empire as well
as of a new religion.  Many of these tribes were Christian,
and to them the Prophet always showed the utmost
kindness and toleration for their worship.  As the
enemies of the hated Jews they had a special claim on
his favour; and it was no doubt to his own advantage
to be on good terms with a religion destined to be the
most powerful in the world.
</p>

<p>
During the last four years of his life the strength
of the Prophet began to flag under the incessant demands
made upon it.  He was now over sixty years of age,
and, just as he was proposing to undertake a new raid
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
into Roman territory, he was attacked by a high fever.
Recovering for a time, he appeared once more in the
mosque at the time of prayer.  Returning to his couch,
his great and increasing weakness warned him that the
end was near.
</p>

<p>
"O God, pardon my sins!" he faltered.  "Yes&mdash;I
come&mdash;among my fellow-citizens on high."
</p>

<p>
Thus he died, in the tenth year after the Hegira.

CHAPTER III
<br />
The Spread of Islam
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  <i>Swift and resistless through the land he passed,<br />
  Like that bold Greek who did the East subdue,<br />
  And made to battles such heroic haste<br />
  As if on wings of victory he flew.</i><br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Of those sovereigns visited by the envoys of
Mohammed and bidden to give their allegiance
to the Prophet, was Khosru, King of Persia,
who, in utter disdain of such a demand, tore the letter
to pieces.
</p>

<p>
"Beware, O king," said the messenger as he departed,
"for in the days to come your kingdom shall be
treated as you have treated the written words of the
Prophet."
</p>

<p>
The idea of an unknown sect from an Arabian desert
attacking the power of the "Great King" seemed
preposterous to those who heard, for Persia was then at
the height of one of her spasmodic periods of success.
Some eighteen years before the envoy of Islam appeared
at his court the king had covered his empire with glory
by the capture of Jerusalem (611 A.D.), then in the hands
of Rome, and inhabited chiefly by Christians.  On this
occasion the Jews throughout Palestine rose on his behalf
with the object of exterminating the Christians, ninety
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
thousand of whom are said to have perished.  "Every
Christian church was demolished, that of the Holy
Sepulchre was the object of furious hatred; the stately
building of Helena and Constantine was abandoned to
the flames; the devout offerings of three hundred years
were rifled in one sacrilegious day."[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>]  Fortunately for
future ages, the great church, built by the pious Helena
over the place where the body of Christ had lain, was not
entirely destroyed; but&mdash;a worse blow still to the
Christian inhabitants&mdash;the True Cross was taken from
its sacred hiding place and carried Into Persia.

<p>
Egypt had also fallen into the hands of the conquering
Khosru, when at length Heraclius, the Emperor of the
East, "slumbering on the throne of Constantinople,"
awoke, drove the Persian from Syria and Egypt,
restored the ruined churches of Jerusalem, and brought
back in triumph the Cross to the Holy City.
</p>

<p>
The preceding year had seen the fall of Khosru, and
peace concluded between the Empires of Rome and
Persia; eight years later Jerusalem was in the hands
of the Saracens (637 A.D.).
</p>

<p>
The years intervening between this event and the
death of Mohammed had been utilised by the sons of
Islam in making a series of conquests, which seem
well-nigh miraculous.  We can indeed only account for them
by the fact that the contest was between a race of
fighters, stirred by their new faith to a perfect frenzy
of enthusiasm, and the remnants of Empires far gone
in decay.
</p>

<p>
Yet, even so, there was no light task.  Chaldaea and
Babylonia, perhaps the most ancient empires in the
world, fell before the sword of Islam only after a long
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
and terrible struggle.  The bloodshed on both sides was
appalling, but the ever-increasing numbers of Moslems
were always providing fresh recruits, eager to win
victory or Paradise.  Even when they were less
numerous than their enemies, they more than made
up for it by the determination and obstinacy of their
attacks.
</p>

<p>
Emboldened by this success, the Saracens flung
themselves upon the Empire of Persia.  Three months after
the great battle of Cadesia, the "white palace" of
Khosru was in their hands, and the remnants of the
Persian hosts had fled before them.
</p>

<p>
The story of Harmozan, the Prince of Susa, Persia's
most important city, shows the craft of the native Persian,
and the binding nature of the Islamite promise.  Brought
before Omar the Caliph of Islam, stripped of his gorgeous
robes, bullied and insulted, Harmozan complained of
intolerable thirst.  They brought him a cup of water,
which he eyed askance.
</p>

<p>
"What ails the man?" cried Omar.  "I fear, my lord,
lest I be killed even as I drink," confessed Harmozan.
"Be of good courage," replied the Caliph, "your life
is safe till you have drunk the water."  Instantly the
crafty ruler dashed the cup to the ground, and when
Omar would have avenged his deceit, the bystanders
promptly reminded him that the word of a Moslem is as
sacred as an oath.  Harmozan was liberated, and became
speedily a convert to a religion which taught so well how
to "keep faith."
</p>

<p>
While these conquests were being made in the East,
the forces of Omar had been making equal progress in the
West.
</p>

<p>
Palestine was their destination, and Damascus, that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
famous city, the centre of immense trade, their first
prey.
</p>

<p>
From thence they advanced upon Jerusalem, taking
town after town on the way.  A siege of four months
convinced the Christian Patriarch that it was hopeless to
hold out longer.  All he now demanded was that Omar
himself should come to take possession, on the ground
that it was written in the sacred book of the Jews that
the city should one day fall into the hands of a king
having but four letters in his name.
</p>

<p>
In Arabia the word "Omar" fulfilled this condition,
and forthwith the Caliph arrived, in the plainest garb,
riding upon a camel, and bearing with him his pouch of
grain and dates and his skin of water.
</p>

<p>
To meet him came the chieftains he had sent out two
years before, clad in the rich cloths of Damascus.
</p>

<p>
"Is it thus ye come before me?" cried Omar in
disgust, throwing a handful of sand in their faces.
Dismayed for a moment, they recollected themselves, and,
opening their gorgeous robes, revealed the armour
beneath.
</p>

<p>
"Enough!" cried the Caliph.  "Go forward!"
</p>

<p>
The terms arranged were by no means harsh, though
clearly marking the inferior position of the conquered
Christians.  No crosses were to be shown, nor church
bells rung in the street.  A Christian must rise and stand
in the presence of a Moslem.  The latter might practise
his religion and use his church undisturbed; but the
great mosque of Omar was to rise over the ruined altar
of the temple and over the sacred stone upon which the
patriarch Jacob had once rested his head.
</p>

<p>
Strange as it may seem, the two races settled down
side by side in peace and friendship.  Both acknowledged
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
the holiness of the Israelites of old, whose bones lay
buried in the neighbourhood of the Holy City.  Within
its walls the Mohammedans treated with respect, if not
with reverence, the worship of Him whom they regarded
as a prophet not far inferior to their own.  Thus four
centuries rolled quietly away, until the old distinction
between conquerors and conquered had almost ceased
to exist, and pilgrims from all parts of Christendom were
welcomed by Christian and Moslem alike.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the forces of Islam threatened to overrun
the greater part of the known world.  The Saracens
"rode masters of the sea," throughout the Greek
archipelago; their sway was recognised towards the East
up to the sources of the Euphrates and Tigris, to the
North they had spread over Asia Minor deep to the very
walls of Constantinople, the seat of the Eastern Empire.
</p>

<p>
Egypt was conquered by Amrou, one of the most
famous generals of the Caliph Omar.  With Egypt fell
Alexandria, a city renowned for its learning, and especially
for its magnificent library, through the civilised world.
</p>

<p>
"I have taken," Amrou told the Caliph, "the great city
of the West.  It contains four thousand palaces, four
thousand baths, four hundred theatres or places of
amusement, twelve thousand shops for the sale of vegetable
food, and forty thousand tributary Jews.  The town
has been subdued by force of arms, without treaty or
capitulation, and the Moslems are impatient to seize the
fruits of their victory."
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for the inhabitants, who were the last to
be referred to, Omar would not allow slaughter or
pillage.  But if the tale be true, the fate of the famous
library of Alexandria shows very clearly the narrow
limits of Saracen culture in those days.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
</p>

<p>
A learned scholar of the city, who had won the liking
and respect of Amrou, entreated that the library might
be given over to him, as the Moslems would have no use
for it.  The question was referred to Omar, who replied,
"If these writings of the Greeks agree with the Book of
God, they are useless, and need not be preserved; if they
disagree, they are harmful, and should be destroyed."
And forthwith the priceless volumes were committed to
the flames.
</p>

<p>
Six years later (647 A.D.) the warrior Othman
accomplished the conquest of Northern Africa; and a little
more than sixty years later, a small expedition of
Saracens crossed the Straits of Gibraltar and set foot
in Spain.  Their leader, Tarif, gave his name to the
place (Tarifa) where he landed, and likewise to the
"tariff" or "duty" levied upon the vessels which
passed through the straits.
</p>

<p>
At Xeres they were met by Roderick, the "last of the
Goths," who was killed, and whose army was put to flight
by the forces of the Saracens, or Moors as they were
called after their settlement in Mauretania or Morocco,
just across the straits.  But the conquest of Spain by the
Moors, teeming as it is with romantic interest, is too
long to be related here, and we must retrace our steps to
the East.
</p>

<p>
By the end of the first half of the eighth century, and
only a little over a hundred years after Mohammed's
death, the Saracens had brought their career of conquest
almost to an end, and were firmly established as "the
most potent and absolute monarchs of the globe."  One
determined attempt, indeed, was made during the latter
half of the century to take Constantinople, the capital
of the Eastern Empire.  A battle was fought beneath the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
walls of the city, and the Saracens were victorious; but
they were prevailed upon to retire on the promise of an
immense yearly tribute.
</p>

<p>
The beginning of the ninth century saw the Eastern
and Western worlds ruled respectively by those two
famous monarchs of history and romance, Haroun-Al-Raschid
and Charlemagne.  The first is familiar to
most of us through the enchanting pages of the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>, but history unfortunately gives us a
darker portrait of the renowned Caliph, painting him
as a jealous and selfish tyrant.  He was, however, a
patron of literature and of art, which distinguishes him
from his predecessors, who were merely warriors.  He
could fight, too, on occasion, both with tongue and
sword.  A new Emperor of Constantinople chose to
refuse the tribute promised by the late Empress in these
words.
</p>

<p>
"Nicephorus, King of the Greeks, to Haroun, King of
the Arabs.
</p>

<p>
"The late Queen was too humble; she submitted to
pay tribute to you, though she should have exacted
twice as much from you.  A man speaks to you now;
therefore send back the tribute you have received,
otherwise the sword shall be umpire between me and
thee."
</p>

<p>
The Caliph replied in unmistakable terms&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"In the name of Allah, most merciful!"
</p>

<p>
"Haroun-al-Raschid, Commander of the Faithful, to
Nicephorus, the Roman dog.
</p>

<p>
"I have read thy letter, O thou son of an unbelieving
mother!  Thou shalt not hear, but thou shalt see my
reply."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br />
<i>Pilgrims of the XIth Century journeying to the Holy City</i>
</p>

<p>
Forthwith a huge force crossed over into the domains
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
of Nicephorus, and only the promise to pay the tribute
twice, instead of once a year, induced the Caliph to
withdraw his forces.
</p>

<p>
To us, however, the most interesting incident of his
reign is the link that was forged between East and
West when the great Haroun courteously received the
ambassadors of Charlemagne at his court in Bagdad.
He may have been prompted only by a desire to obtain
the Great Emperor of the West as his ally against the
Emperor of the Eastern Empire, but there seems little
doubt that Haroun actually sent to Charlemagne the
keys of the Holy Places at Jerusalem, declaring that the
city belonged first and foremost to the Champion of
Christendom.
</p>

<p>
Charlemagne did not hesitate to avail himself of this
generosity.  Fifty years later, a monk of Brittany, named
Bernard the Wise, described how he was lodged at the
hospital of the most glorious Emperor Charles, wherein
are received all pilgrims who speak Latin, and who come
for a religious reason.  There, too, he discovered the
fine library founded by Charlemagne close by, in the
Church of the Blessed Virgin.  He speaks in high terms
of the relations existing between Christians and Moslems,
both at Jerusalem and in Egypt.
</p>

<p>
"The Christians and Pagans," he says, "have there
such peace between them that, if I should go a journey,
and in this journey my camel or ass which carried my
burdens should die, and I should leave everything there
without a guard, and go to the next town to get another,
on my return I should find all my property untouched."
</p>

<p>
Thus, in peace and security, the long stream of
pilgrims from the West flowed towards the Holy City until
the beginning of the eleventh century.  Then came,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
quite suddenly, a terrible interval of persecution.  The
reigning Caliph, El Hakim, became, as he grew up, a
fierce and fanatical madman.  Inflamed, it is said, by
the report of the Jews, who warned him that unless he
put a stop to the crowds of pilgrims he would soon find
himself without a kingdom, he instituted a fierce
persecution of the Christians, and commanded that the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre should be destroyed.
Another furious outburst was directed against the Jews
themselves, as well as the Christians.  Many were killed,
and many of their churches laid low.
</p>

<p>
Just before his end a fit of remorse seized El Hakim,
and he commanded that the churches of the Christians
should be restored.  Before he could again change his
mind, he was assassinated by command of his own sister,
as being a dangerous madman.
</p>

<p>
A brief interval of toleration followed, which was but
the lull before the storm; for an outbreak of terrible
persecution was to come, an outbreak which was the
immediate cause of the First Crusade.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br />
The Rise of Chivalry
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  <i>A knight there was, and that a worthy man,<br />
  That fro the tyme that he first began<br />
  To riden out, he loved chivalrie,<br />
  Trouthe and honour, freedom and curteisie.</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHAUCER: <i>The Prologue.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
During the interval of comparative peace
that followed the downfall of the mad Caliph
Hakim, a new spirit of religious devotion
began to awaken in Christendom.
</p>

<p>
This was, to a large extent, a reaction from a truly
"dark age"&mdash;the period which immediately preceded
the end of the tenth century.  Famine and pestilence
had devastated Europe, and had resulted in absolute
demoralisation of the population.  Travellers went
their way in fear not only of robbery, but of a far worse
fate.  It was whispered that men, women and children
had been waylaid in forest depths, torn to pieces, and
devoured alive by human wild beasts.  The Church,
in her efforts to bring about a better state of things,
resorted to counsels of despair, and began to preach,
in every part of Christendom, that the end of the world
was at hand, and that the appointed time was the
thousandth year after the birth of Christ.
</p>

<p>
The result was an outburst of intense religious
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
excitement which did much to check the progress of evil and
outrage.  It had a practical outcome, too, as is seen
in that curious institution known as the Truce of God.
In joining this, every knight took an oath not to commit
sacrilege; to treat all travellers with respect; to
"keep the peace" during the sacred days of each
week&mdash;that is, from Wednesday evening to Monday
morning; not to fight for purposes of private revenge,
and always to defend and keep sacred the persons of
women.  Here we have clearly the foundation of that
spirit of chivalry which plays such a prominent part
in the Story of the Crusades.
</p>

<p>
The appointed time for the end of the world came and
went, but the spirit of devotion remained.  A new
interest was awakened in the scenes of the life-work
of the Saviour, and crowds of pilgrims, young and old,
of all ranks and professions, hastened to undertake
the long and toilsome journey to the Holy Land.
</p>

<p>
Many of these suffered under the persecution of
Hakim; and even after his time, though no active
measures were taken against them, they were not
received with the favour shown in former days.  But
this only added zest to the enterprise.  To visit the
Church of the Holy Tomb, and to return and build a
church in his own land, became the ambition of every
man of wealth and high rank; while the poor palmer,
with his staff and hat decorated with palm sprigs or
cockle-shells, became a well-known figure upon the
roads of every country in Europe.
</p>

<p>
Says a writer of that day, "At the time there begun
to flow towards the Holy Sepulchre so great a multitude
as, ere this, no man could have hoped for.  First of
all went the poorer folk, then men of middle rank,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
and lastly, very many kings and counts, marquises
and bishops; aye, and a thing that had never happened
before, many women bent their steps in the same
direction."
</p>

<p>
Things were made a little easier for them by the
conversion of the Huns to Christianity; for this enabled
the pilgrims to pass along the land route through
Hungary instead of crossing the Mediterranean and
travelling through Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Robert the Magnificent, the father of William, the
future "Conqueror," was among these eleventh century
pilgrims, and he, like many another, died before he
could return home.
</p>

<p>
Sweyn, the eldest and worst of the sons of Godwin,
was another; and Eldred, Bishop of York in the days
of William the Conqueror, made the little realm of
England famous at Jerusalem by his gift before the
Holy Sepulchre of a wonderful golden chalice.
</p>

<p>
Side by side with this spirit of religious zeal there
grew up and developed that remarkable body of
sentiment and custom known as chivalry.
</p>

<p>
Chivalry has been described as the "whole duty
of a gentleman"; and when we realise the condition
of barbarism, brutality, and vice out of which even
Western Christendom was only just emerging in the
eleventh century, we can see how important was the
work it had to do.  Religion, Honour, Courtesy&mdash;those
were the three watchwords of the knight of chivalry,
and they covered a wide area of conduct.
</p>

<p>
The education of a knight began at the age of seven,
and commenced with the personal service, which was
regarded in those days as a privilege.  The small boy
was proud to hold the wine-cup behind the chair of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
his lord, or his stirrup when he rode on horseback.
For the next seven years, though much of his time was
spent in waiting upon the ladies of the household, who
taught him reading, writing, music, and the laws of
chivalry, he also learnt the duties of a squire&mdash;how to
hunt and hawk, and to look after the kennels and the
stables.  At the age of fourteen the boy might be called
a squire, when his duty, in addition to those mentioned,
would be to carve for his lord at table, tasting the food
first himself for fear of poison; and also, of course, to
attend upon him at all times.  Thus he had to arm
him for battle, to see that his weapons were in perfect
condition, to fight by his side, and to lie before his door
while he slept.
</p>

<p>
When the squire had mastered all his duties and
obligations, he had then to "win his spurs," that is,
to perform some deed of valour that should prove him
worthy of knighthood.
</p>

<p>
The ceremony of girding on his armour was largely
a religious one.  The whole of the previous night was
spent by him on his knees with his sword held upright
between his hands, before the altar upon which his
armour was laid.  Thus he dedicated himself by prayer
and fasting to the service of God, and on the morrow
was solemnly consecrated by the Church to his high
office, before the armour was actually buckled on.
</p>

<p>
This last part of the ceremony was the privilege
of some fair damsel, to whom the knight was bound
to give devotion and respect.  "To do the pleasure
of ladies was his chief solace and the mainspring of his
service."
</p>

<p>
Another of the features of chivalry was that of
"brotherhood-in-arms," by which two knights vowed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
eternal faith and love to one another.  They dressed
alike, wore similar armour, prayed together, supported
each other in battle and in any kind of quarrel, and had
the same friends and enemies.
</p>

<p>
That their devotion to the rules of chivalry was a
very real thing is proved over and over again by the
conduct of the knights who took part in the Crusades.
It is well expressed by Tristan, in one of the most
famous romances of the chivalric age.  As he lay dying,
he said to his squire, "I take leave of chivalry which
I have so much loved and honoured.  Alas! my sword,
what wilt thou do now?  Wilt thou hear, Sagremor,
the most shameful word that ever passed the lips of
Tristan?  I am conquered.  I give thee my arms, I
give thee my chivalry."
</p>

<p>
It took many a long year to bring to perfection this
great institution, with all its rules and regulations,
and chivalry was but in its infancy when the First
Crusade began.  The two movements developed
together, and many a chivalric lesson was learnt by the
knights of Christendom from the Moslems of the East.
Perhaps, however, one of the most marked effects
of the Crusades upon this greatest of mediæval
institutions was the welding together of the various nations
of Europe in a common knighthood, bound by the
same rules and codes of honour, and fighting for the
same cause.
</p>

<p>
"All wars and brigandage came to an end.  The
Crusade, like the rain, stilled the wind."
</p>

<p>
Out of this combination of the spirit of chivalry,
with that of the Crusades themselves, sprang certain
military orders, which play a very prominent part
in the history of the time.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
</p>

<p>
The first of these was known as the Order of the
Knights Hospitallers.  About the middle of the eleventh
century a guest-house or "hospital," where pilgrims
could be entertained, was established by a company
of Italian merchants, in connection with the Church
of St Mary, opposite that of the Holy Sepulchre, in
Jerusalem.  This hospital, dedicated to St John, was
managed by Benedictine monks, under one called the
"Guardian of the Redeemer's Poor."  When the First
Crusade was over, its hero, Godfrey of Boulogne, visited
the place and found that these good monks had devoted
themselves during the siege of Jerusalem to the care
of the sick and wounded Christians, giving them the
best of all they possessed, and living themselves in
the utmost poverty.  Godfrey at once endowed the
Hospital of St John with lands and money, and set
up one Gerard as its first Grand Master.  A new and
splendid church was built for the monks, and a habit
or dress was prescribed for their use, consisting of a
black robe with a cross of eight points in white linen
upon it&mdash;the famous Maltese Cross of later days.
</p>

<p>
Early in the twelfth century, this company of priests
and holy laymen was changed by its second Grand
Master into a military order, bound to carry on the
same kind of charitable work in tending the sick and
wounded, but specially to defend the Holy Sepulchre
by force of arms.  Many of this order of "Brothers"
had been originally knights who had retired from the
world and taken religious vows; hence it was said that
the changes merely "gave back to the brethren the
arms that they had quitted."  These were now
distinguished from the rest by a red surcoat with the white
cross worn over armour.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
</p>

<p>
Except for the obligation of fighting the vows were
not changed, and these Knights Hospitallers owed
the same allegiance to the three-fold laws of obedience,
chastity, and poverty as ordinary monks.  The brethren
were to be the "servants of the poor"; no member
could call anything his own; he might not marry;
he could use arms only against the Saracen; but he was
independent of any authority save that of the Pope.
</p>

<p>
This Order became immensely popular; in the thirteenth
century it numbered fifteen thousand knights, many of
them drawn from the noblest houses of Christendom;
and it is much to its credit that, at a time when chivalry
had become little more than a name, it upheld the old
traditions even when it had been driven from Palestine,
and forced to find a new home for itself at Rhodes.
Driven from thence in the sixteenth century, the Knights
of St John were settled by the Emperor Charles V. at
Malta, where they remained until the days of the
French Revolution.
</p>

<p>
The Order of the Knights Templars was founded
early in the twelfth century by Baldwin, then King
of Jerusalem, as a "perpetual sacred soldiery," whose
special object was to defend the Holy Sepulchre and
the passes infested by brigands which led the pilgrims
to Jerusalem.  Their headquarters was a building
granted them by Baldwin, close to the temple on
Mt. Moriah.  War was their first and most important
business, though they were bound by their rule to a
certain amount of prayer and fasting.  The latter was,
however, easily relaxed, and "to drink like a Templar"
became a proverb.
</p>

<p>
In every battle of the Holy War these two Orders
took a prominent part; the post of honour on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
right being claimed by the Templars, that on the left
by the Hospitallers.  Unlike most other knights, the
Templars wore long beards, and from their dress of white,
with a large red cross upon it, they gained the title
of the Red-Cross Knights.
</p>

<p>
You will, no doubt, remember that Spenser's knight
in the first book of the Faery Queene was of that order.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>And on his breast a bloudy cross he bore<br />
  In dear remembrance of his dying lord.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Their banner was half black, half white; "fair and
favourable to the friends of Christ, black and terrible to
His foes."
</p>

<p>
These Knights Templars, by their arrogance and
independence, made for themselves many enemies, and
early in the fourteenth century they were strongly
opposed by Philip of France.  By this time they were
established in various parts of Europe, and one of their
most powerful "houses" was the building known as the
"Temple" in Paris, the members of which openly defied
the authority of the king.
</p>

<p>
With some difficulty the consent of a weak Pope was
obtained for their destruction.  On a given day, when
the Grand Master and most of his knights were staying
in France, every Templar in the country was seized,
imprisoned, and tortured until he had confessed crimes,
many of which he probably had never imagined in his
wildest moments.  More than five hundred were burnt
alive, as a preliminary to the Order being declared
extinct.  Whether the Templars deserved their terrible
fate may well be a matter of doubt, though public
opinion, in their own day, was decidedly against them.
It is generally considered that Philip's treatment of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
an order, the members of which had again and again laid
down their lives for the cause of God, ranks as one of the
blackest crimes of history.
</p>

<p>
There is a legend to the effect that on each anniversary
of the suppression of the Order, the heads of seven of the
martyred Templars rise from their graves to meet a
phantom figure clad in the red-cross mantle.  The latter
cries three times, "Who shall now defend the Holy
Temple?  Who shall free the Sepulchre of the Lord?"
</p>

<p>
And the seven heads make mournful reply, "None!
The Temple is destroyed."
</p>

<p>
The Temple Church, in London, was originally built
for the English branch of this great Order, the members
of which in England, as well as in Spain and Germany,
were almost all acquitted of the charges brought against
them.
</p>

<p>
But we must now return to the period prior to the
foundation of these two great Orders, with which are
associated most of the gallant deeds of the Holy War.

CHAPTER V
<br />
The Story of Peter the Hermit
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  <i>Great troops of people travelled thitherward<br />
  Both day and night, of each degree and place<br />
  But Jew returned, having 'scaped hard<br />
  With hateful beggary or foul disgrace.</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPENSER: <i>Faery Queene.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Some twenty years after the death of Hakim, the
countries round about the Holy Land began to be
harassed by a new and terrible foe.  From far-off
Turkestan had migrated a fierce fighting tribe, the
descendants of one Seljuk, and known to history as the
Seljukian Turks.  Wherever they went they conquered,
until half-way through the eleventh century, their
leader drove out the Saracen rulers of Bagdad and made
himself Caliph.
</p>

<p>
His successor was converted to Islam, and with added
power, swept over Asia Minor and settled in the city
of Nicæa, in threatening proximity to Constantinople.
</p>

<p>
This invasion was the more terrible in that it brought
in its train a relapse to barbarism, for these Turks were
barbarians, hordes of robbers and brigands, who cared
for nothing but plunder and violence.
</p>

<p>
Alexios, the weak Emperor of the Eastern Empire,
quailed at their approach, and looked on in terror at the
spectacle of Christian churches destroyed and Christian
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
children sold into slavery.  But he appealed in vain for
aid to the kingdom of the West.  To unite Western
Christendom against a far-off foe was a task beyond the
powers of the tottering Empire of the East.
</p>

<p>
That inspiration, however, was at hand.  In 1076, the
Seljukian Turks conquered Jerusalem, and at once began
a reign of terror for Christian inhabitants and pilgrims.
The Patriarch, or Bishop of Jerusalem, was dragged
through the street by his white hair, and flung into a
dungeon, until his people could gather a sum sufficient to
pay his ransom.  The holiest sacrament of the Church was
profaned by the barbarians, who invaded the buildings
and insisted upon sharing in the rite.  Pilgrims were
stripped and beaten on the roads and passes that led to
the Holy City; many suffered martyrdom as they knelt
before the Holy Tomb.  Out of seven thousand who set
out from Germany in one year, only two thousand
returned to tell a tale of cruel murder and outrage.  The
marvel is that such a terrible state of things was allowed
to exist so long, without anything being done to remedy
it.  Pope Gregory VII. (Hildebrand) did indeed gather an
army in the latter part of the eleventh century, but his
energy was dissipated in the hopeless task of asserting
the power of the Pope over the Emperor, and his army
was eventually dispersed.
</p>

<p>
Robert Guiscard, the Norman, actually crossed the sea
with his troops in 1081, when death overtook him; and
for a time the unhappy pilgrims seemed to be left to their
fate.  Then suddenly was heard a "voice calling in the
wilderness," the voice of one who was to be the herald of
the First Crusade.
</p>

<p>
The story goes that a certain poor hermit named
Peter, a native of the French city of Amiens, set out to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
go to Jerusalem in the year 1098.  He had, like every one
else, heard of the horrors he might be called upon to
endure, but pushed on, undeterred, until, possibly
because of his poverty, he arrived safely within the Holy
City.  He found the condition of things even worse
than he expected.  The very stones of the great church
were stained with the blood of the martyrs; the cries of
tortured women rang in his ears; the patriarch Simeon
confessed that he had lost heart and was little better than
a slave in the Moslem's hands.  It was clear that the
Emperor of the East, their proper protector, would never
act up to his responsibilities.  To whom, then, could they
look for aid?
</p>

<p>
"The nations of the West shall take up arms in your
cause," cried the dauntless Peter, and he forthwith
promised to visit the Pope and obtain his help and
sympathy on his return journey, if the Patriarch would
give him letters to the Church of Rome.
</p>

<p>
That night, says the legend, Peter meant to spend in
watching at the tomb of the Saviour, and there he fell
asleep.  And as he slept, the figure of the Redeemer stood
before him, and with hand outstretched, bade him
hasten to fulfil his great task, saying, "So shalt thou
make known the woes of My people, and rouse the
faithful to cleanse the Holy Places from the infidel; for
through danger and trial of every kind shall the elect
now enter the gates of Paradise."
</p>

<p>
With these words ringing in his ears, the Hermit at
once hurried to the coast and sailed for Italy.  He came
before Pope Urban II. at the very time when the envoys
of the Emperor of Constantinople were knocking very
hard at the doors of Rome.  Urban therefore did
not hesitate to bless the enterprise of Peter, and to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
bid him go forth and preach a Crusade in his own way.
</p>

<p>
To induce kings, princes, and nobles, to leave their
lands and go to fight in a cause from which they could
gain no apparent profit, needed considerable time, and
Urban himself undertook the difficult task.  But he was
wise enough to see that the peculiar power of Peter the
Hermit could be used in stirring up the ordinary people,
the simple-minded and the poor, to take up arms for the
cause of Christ.  So, as a writer of his own time puts it,
"The hermit set out, from whence I know not, but we
saw him passing through the towns and villages,
preaching everywhere, and the people surrounding him in
crowds, loading him with offerings and celebrating his
sanctity with such great praises that I never remember
such honour bestowed on any one."
</p>

<p>
Throughout Italy and France and along the banks
of the Rhine journeyed the strange inspired figure, with
head and feet bare, his thin frame wrapped in a coarse
cloak, holding before him a great crucifix as he rode upon
an ass.
</p>

<p>
"He preached to innumerable crowds in the churches,
the streets and the highways; the Hermit entered with
equal confidence the palace and the cottage; and the
people were impetuously moved by his call to repentance
and to arms.  When he painted the sufferings of the
natives and pilgrims of Palestine, every heart was
melted to compassion; every breast glowed with
indignation when he challenged the warriors of the age to
defend their brethren and rescue their Saviour."[<a id="chap05fn1text"></a><a href="#chap05fn1">1</a>]

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
While Southern Europe was thus being stirred to
enthusiasm by being brought into personal contact with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
one who had seen for himself the woes of the Holy Land,
Pope Urban had already called a council to consider the
matter in a practical form.  At this Council of Placentia,
however, the chief part of the attention of those present
was drawn to the representations of the Greek Emperor,
on whose behalf ambassadors pleaded the cause of the
city of Constantinople.  If that city fell before the
threatened onslaught of the Turks, they said, Christianity
must perish for ever in the East, and nothing but a
narrow stretch of sea kept the Moslems from the gates of
the capital city of the Eastern Empire.
</p>

<p>
At these words the deepest sympathy was expressed,
but it was suggested that the best way of succouring the
threatened city was to draw off the attention of the Turks
by an attack upon Palestine itself.  This was just what
Urban desired.  A definite march upon Jerusalem
would fire the imaginations of men of all ranks far more
than an attempt to defend Constantinople before it
was actually besieged.  The old jealousy between the
Eastern and Western Empire had to be reckoned with;
and the Emperor Alexios was no heroic figure to stand for
the Cause of Christ.  The whole question, was, therefore,
deferred until the autumn of 1095, when a Council was
summoned at Clermont in France.
</p>

<p>
That dull November day witnessed a most striking
scene.  The vast open square in front of the Cathedral
was crammed with people of all classes drawn from all
quarters by the rumour that the subject of a Crusade
would be discussed.  From the great western door,
immediately after High Mass, emerged the figure of the
Pope, and a number of bishops and cardinals, dressed
in vestments glowing with colour, followed him upon the
high scaffold covered with red cloth.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
</p>

<p>
With cross outstretched in his left hand, the Pope
held up his right to command attention, and then began
to speak.  "Who can preserve the force of that
eloquence?" says one who stood by, and heard him point
out that the Turks, having pushed their way to the edge
of the Western World, and even then holding parts of
Spain and Sicily, must now be driven forth from that
holiest place, where Christianity alone had a right to
enter.
</p>

<p>
Turning to the knights who stood by, leaning upon
their swords, Urban addressed them in words of fire.
</p>

<p>
"Were they spending their days in empty quarrels,
shearing their brethren like sheep?  Let them go forth
and fight boldly for the Cause of God.  Christ himself
would be their leader as, more valiant than the Israelites
of old, they fought for their Jerusalem.  A goodly thing
would it be for them to die in that city, where Christ for
them laid down His life.  Let them, as valiant knights,
descendants of unconquered sires, remember the vigour
of their ancestors and go forth to conquer or to die."
</p>

<p>
This appeal stirred the multitude to its depths.
</p>

<p>
"DEUS VULT!  DEUS VULT!"[<a id="chap05fn2text"></a><a href="#chap05fn2">2</a>] went up to heaven
in one great roar of voices, and the cry was at once
seized upon by Urban.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap05fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap05fn2text">2</a>] It is the will of God!  It is the will of God!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Let these words be your war-cry," he exclaimed.
"When you attack the enemy, let the words resound
from every side, 'God wills it.'  Go forth then;
many sufferings will be yours, but you may redeem your
souls at the expense of your bodies.  Rid God's sanctuary
of the wicked; expel the robbers; bring in the holy
souls.  These things I command, and for their carrying
out I fix the end of next spring.  If you have rich
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
possessions here, you are promised better ones in the Holy
Land.  Those who die will enter the mansions of heaven,
while the living shall behold the sepulchre of their Lord.
Ye are soldiers of the Cross; wear then on your breasts,
or on your shoulders, the blood-red sign of Him who died
for the salvation of your souls.  Wear it as a token that
His help will never fail you; wear it as a pledge of a vow
which can never be recalled."
</p>

<p>
Another mighty burst of applause followed these words.
</p>

<p>
Crowds of bishops and knights at once pressed forward
to take the red cross badges which had been prepared, and
Adhemar, Bishop of Puy, the first to do so, was at once
appointed as spiritual head of the expedition, with
Raymond, Count of Toulouse, as its military leader.
</p>

<p>
In the months that followed, all Southern Europe
rang with the sounds of riveting armour and of forging
steel.  The actual departure of the Crusaders had been
finally appointed for the August of 1090, but this was not
early enough for the fervent spirits who had been
already stirred to the depths by Peter the Hermit.
</p>

<p>
In the month of March, without preparation or
provision for the journey, a vast concourse of some sixty
thousand men and women turned their faces to the East,
with Peter as their leader.  As a writer of the time
says, "Lands were deserted of their labourers; houses
of their inhabitants; even whole cities migrated.  You
might see the husband departing with his wife, yea, with
all his family, you would smile to see the whole household
laden on a waggon, about to proceed on their journey.
The road was too narrow for the passengers, the paths
too hedged-in for the travellers, so thickly were they
thronged by endless multitudes."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
</p>

<p>
About fifteen thousand pilgrims, mostly French,
assembled in this way at Cologne, about Easter 1096;
and finding Peter unwilling to start before the German
contingent had come up, they set off under a leader known
as Walter the Penniless, and made for Constantinople.
To do this they had to pass through Hungary, a wild and
barren tract, the people of which had only lately been
converted to Christianity; and here the rough discipline
which Walter, by mere force of character, had managed
to impose upon the horde that followed him, entirely
broke down.  Food being denied them, the pilgrims
began to plunder.  The Hungarians at once took up
arms, and soon scattered the so-called troops in all
directions.  Hundreds took refuge in a church, which
was promptly fired, and most of those within were
burnt to death.  Only a few thousand managed to hide
in the woods and so escape; and this poor remnant,
being collected with pain and difficulty by Walter the
Penniless, made their way to Constantinople and put
themselves under the protection of the Emperor until
Peter should arrive.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, the Hermit had started, with a German
following of about forty thousand people.  Amongst these
were quite a large number of women and children, many
of whom doubtless did their part by cheering and helping
their men-folk on the long road.  But the hardships of
the way told heavily on them, many fell out and lingered
behind, beseeching the men to wait for them.  Long
forced marches were an impossibility, and a disorderly
progress was made, in spite of the fact that they had
more provisions and more money than their predecessors
on the road.
</p>

<p>
At length they came to the spot where so many of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
Walter's followers had lost their lives.  The place was
but too well marked out by the weapons and crosses of the
pilgrims which now adorned the walls and houses of the
neighbouring town.  In a wild outburst of fury, the mob
threw itself upon the inhabitants, all unsuspecting as they
were, and massacred them by the thousand.  Enraged
at this treatment of his people, the Hungarian King
came down upon them with his forces, just as the
pilgrims were endeavouring to cross the river into
Bulgaria, and many perished before they could escape.
</p>

<p>
Once again, in crossing through Bulgaria, the
undisciplined host came to blows with their
fellow-Christians living in those lands.  In vain did Peter
represent that valuable lives, time and money was
being wasted.  About ten thousand lost their lives.
Peter himself barely escaped to a wood, where he
wandered about all night in misery, thinking that all his
host was slain.  Next day, however, he managed to
collect about seven thousand, and as he marched on,
other refugees joined him, until at length he found himself
at the head of about half the force with which he had
set out.  Famished and gaunt, having lost nearly all the
women and children, as well as food, clothes and money,
Peter hurried them on till at length quite exhausted, they
reached the walls of Constantinople.
</p>

<p>
Here they found the remnant of the army of Walter
the Penniless, who had, from the first, kept his men
under better control than had the Hermit.  It was only
too clear, however, that neither army was in a fit state to
carry on a difficult warfare with the fighting Turks.  The
Emperor Alexios, therefore, persuaded them to rest and
recruit until the organised Crusading Army should appear,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
meantime giving them all they could require, and treating
them with the greatest kindness.
</p>

<p>
But it seemed as though a curse, instead of a blessing,
rested upon these forerunners of the First Crusade.
</p>

<p>
The pilgrims became quite unruly, burnt the houses of
their hosts, stripped the lead from some of the churches
and actually tried to sell it to the inhabitants of the city.
The Greeks naturally turned against their ill-mannered
guests, and Alexios, dreading the consequences,
persuaded Peter to take them with him over the Bosphorus
into Asia Minor.
</p>

<p>
Thankful for his aid in transporting them, Peter
got his men across the strait, but, all too soon
after they had encamped on the other side, a fresh
quarrel broke out between the followers of Walter
and those of Peter.  Utterly unable to control his
own men, Peter threw up his task and retired to
Constantinople alone.
</p>

<p>
Freed from all pretence of control, and mad with the
knowledge that they were free, about ten thousand of
these pilgrims began to plunder the neighbouring country,
and finally made their way under the very walls of
Nicæa, where the Turks were encamped.  Here, under
the daring leadership of one Reinaldo, they actually took
a fortress, and, when the Turkish Sultan advanced
against them from Nicæa, left a good part of their army
to defend it while the rest came face to face with the
troops of Islam.
</p>

<p>
Needless to say, the pilgrims were hopelessly defeated;
only their leaders and a handful of men escaped to the
fortress, but even here there was no safety for them.
The Sultan did not even trouble to besiege it.  He
merely starved them out until they were forced to yield.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
The end of the story is a dismal one, seeing to what end
the pilgrims had pledged themselves.  Offered the
alternative of death or Islam, by far the greater number
accepted the latter, and the few faithful were slain
before their eyes.
</p>

<p>
A cruel trap was laid for that section of the army
which had stayed behind with Walter the Penniless.
The Turks, whose troops were now harassing the
Christian camp, caused a rumour to be spread that
Reinaldo and his men had taken possession of Nicæa.
At once the camp rose like one man and demanded a
share in the plunder.  In vain Walter warned, entreated,
threatened; heedless of his warning, the infatuated
pilgrims rushed towards the city, unhindered, until they
found themselves in the midst of a large plain before the
walls.  Then, all at once the troops of the Sultan David
flung themselves upon them from every side.  Helpless
they fell, with Walter in their midst.  About three
thousand managed to escape, and fled back to
Constantinople, the rest of that vast host either perished
on the field or were brutally massacred afterwards by
their conquerors.
</p>

<p>
Knowing nothing of the awful failure of their
predecessors, a third army, led by a German priest named
Gotschalk, advanced as far as Hungary.  There the
story almost repeats itself.  The people of Hungary
refused to let them pass through; and their king,
panic-stricken at their appearance, captured them by a cruel
trick.  Calling them to his presence, he told them that his
people only opposed them because they came in hostile
fashion; but if they would lay down their arms, they
should be protected during their passage through his
country, and have their weapons restored on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
frontier.  This the unhappy pilgrims did, to be
immediately massacred by the Hungarians.
</p>

<p>
Twice again we hear of the setting out of lawless
troops, bent even more openly on plunder than their
predecessors, and twice again we hear of the Danube
running red with the blood of those slain by the hosts of
Carloman of Hungary.
</p>

<p>
Nothing, of course, could have been hoped from such
undisciplined hordes; but perhaps they served the
purpose, at the cost of a quarter of a million lives, of
warning the more thoughtful Crusaders of the dangers
of the way, and, of the need of absolute control and able
guidance.
</p>

<p>
And thus, "the chaff being winnowed with the fan out
of God's store, the good grain began to appear."

CHAPTER VI

The Story of the Emperor Alexios
and the First Crusade

<p class="intro">
  <i>Nought is more honourable to a knight<br />

  And wrong redress in such as wend awry<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the August of 1096, the first great army of the
Crusaders began to move towards the East, under
the command of Godfrey of Boulogne, together
with his brothers Eustace and Baldwin.
</p>

<p>
This Godfrey, leader of the Teuton host, is thus
described by one of his own day: "He was of a
beautiful countenance, tall of stature, agreeable in
his discourse, of excellent morals, and at the same time
so gentle that he seemed better fitted for the monk than
for the knight.  But when his enemies appeared before
him, and the combat was at hand, his soul became
filled with a mighty daring; like a lion, he feared
not for his own person; and what shield, what buckler,
could withstand the fall of his sword?"
</p>

<p>
Four other armies set out after him in due course,
travelling by land to Constantinople; for, in those
days, not even the stoutest general could face the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
horrors of a sea-voyage in the untrustworthy vessels
of the Mediterranean shore.
</p>

<p>
Marching through Europe in perfect order, Godfrey's
troops met their first check on the borders of Hungary.
Here they not only found the track marked out by
the bodies of those who had perished in the previous
year, but a distinct air of hostility was seen in the
attitude of the people.  Knowing nothing of the actual
facts, Godfrey cautiously arranged for a meeting
with King Carloman.  Matters were explained on both
sides and a mutual arrangement was made by which
Godfrey's troops were allowed to pass through Hungary
buying food as they went, while Baldwin, the brother
of Godfrey, with his wife and children remained behind
as hostages until the Crusaders should arrive at the
further boundary&mdash;the River Save.
</p>

<p>
"So, day by day, in silence and peace, with equal
measure and just sale, did the duke and his people
pass through the realms of Hungary."
</p>

<p>
Once within the Emperor's domains, one would have
thought the Crusaders on safe ground.  But this was
by no means the case.  The second army of the Crusaders,
which started almost at the same time as the first,
was led by the brother of the French King, Hugh of
Vermandois, a headstrong and self-willed prince.  He
chose, together with Robert of Normandy, son of
the Conqueror, and some less important leaders, to
make his own way through Italy in disorderly fashion;
and after leaving in that pleasant land many of his
followers with Duke Robert, he embarked at Bari
for the East.  A tempest cast him on the Austrian
coast, which was under the Emperor's rule.  Hugh
at once despatched four and twenty knights dressed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
in golden armour to demand a fitting reception for
himself and his followers; and was answered by the
arrival of an armed escort, which led him as a prisoner
before the Governor.  There was some excuse for the
conduct of Alexios, extraordinary as it seems; for,
so far, the hordes of so-called Crusaders had brought
such desolation and destruction upon his land that
he had come to the conclusion that the Turks, at this
time apparently inactive, were safer neighbours than
the troops of Christendom.  But Alexios was as wily
as he was timid.  After a short imprisonment, Hugh
was brought to Constantinople and treated as the
honoured guest of the Emperor&mdash;treated indeed so well
that he fell a victim to his host's perfidious charm,
did homage to him, and promised to persuade the
other chieftains to follow his example.
</p>

<p>
This was the state of affairs when Godfrey of Boulogne
appeared on the plains of Thrace, and hearing of
the imprisonment of Count Hugh, he sent at once a
peremptory message to demand his release.  This
demand met with absolute refusal, upon which Godfrey
promptly gave orders to ravage the surrounding country.
</p>

<p>
Immediately alarmed, as usual, by the prospect
of armed conflict, Alexios implored Godfrey to desist
and to meet him in friendly conference at Constantinople.
To this Godfrey agreed, and was met by Hugh himself
outside the city walls.  The latter sang the praises
of the Emperor with enthusiasm, but Godfrey was still
on his guard.  A warning had reached him from some
French merchants living in the city that treachery
was meditated; and he therefore refused either to
enter within the walls or to partake of the rich food
which the Emperor sent to the camp.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
</p>

<p>
Then Alexios vainly tried to persuade the Crusader
to settle his army for the winter in the luxurious quarters
of the Greek nobles across the Bosphorus, where they
would act as a buffer between Constantinople and
hostile forces from the East, at the same time removing
themselves to a safe distance from the city.
</p>

<p>
This also Godfrey refused; and the alarm of the
Emperor grew into panic when he realised that the
army of another Crusader, Bohemond, his ancient
enemy, who had already established a claim upon a
large part of his Empire, was fast nearing his boundaries.
It was absolutely necessary to make friends with Godfrey
before the arrival of the dreaded Bohemond.  As there
seemed a possibility of the Crusaders, in their wrath
at the refusal of supplies, attacking the city itself, a
compact was made.  Godfrey had no desire to use
up his strength in fighting fellow-Christians, and readily
accepted the Emperor's terms.  The son of Alexios
was sent as hostage to his camp, and the leaders,
on their side, swore fealty to the Emperor for the time
they were obliged to remain on his borders, and forthwith
entered the city in peace and security.
</p>

<p>
But Alexios was still consumed with secret terror
of the vast host which had swarmed into his land;
and, on the pretext of an insufficient food supply, he
managed to persuade Godfrey, after a brief sojourn,
to transport his troops across the Bosphorus.  With
his usual craft, he then arranged that the vessels which
had taken them over should immediately return.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the dreaded arrival of Bohemond, Prince
of Tarentum, had actually taken place.  A weak
attempt was made to drive him back by force;
but this was quickly overcome, and when Bohemond
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
sent the prisoners taken in the conflict back to the
Emperor with an indignant and reproachful message, the
wily Alexios promptly disowned all knowledge of the
affair, professed the most affectionate regard for his
ancient enemy, and sent him a pressing invitation to
visit the capital city.
</p>

<p>
Now Bohemond was of a very different nature from
the simple and upright Godfrey of Boulogne.  He
was an excellent leader, bold and skilful in warfare,
but his character was warped by a mean, designing,
and crafty spirit which entirely incapacitated him from
playing a heroic part.  When met by Godfrey in
Constantinople and informed by him of the terms made
with Alexios, he declared at first that nothing in heaven
or on earth should induce him to swear fealty to his
former foe.  The Emperor ceased to press the matter,
and merely treated him with more than ordinary
magnificence of hospitality.  Then, as though by
chance, the Count was one day taken by an officer to
a great room in the palace, crammed with costly jewels,
ornaments of gold and silver, rich silks and brocades.
The man's weak point had been observed too well.
"What conquests might not be made if I possessed
such a treasure!" cried Bohemond.
</p>

<p>
"It is your own!" replied the officer.  The promise
of an independent lordship near Antioch completed
the bribe, and Count Bohemond was no longer to be
feared.
</p>

<a id="img-075"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-075.jpg" alt="Map of the Crusades" />
<br />
Map of the Crusades
</p>

<p>
Of very different stuff was Raymond, Count of
Toulouse, the first to volunteer but the last of the
Crusading chiefs actually to set out for the East.  He
was now over fifty years of age, and, declaring that
that was the last journey he should ever make, he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
determined to be well prepared.  With the idea of
choosing a route as yet untried by his predecessors,
Raymond took his way through Lombardy into the
desolate country of Dalmatia and Slavonia.
</p>

<p>
"It was already winter," says a writer of the time,
"when Raymond's men were toiling over the barren
mountains of Dalmatia, where for three weeks we saw
neither beast nor bird.  For almost forty days did we
struggle on through mists so thick that we could actually
feel them, and brush them aside with a motion of the
hand."  The weak, the sick, and the old suffered terribly
from the attacks of the wild natives upon their rear;
the bareness of the country gave no chance of even
purchasing food, much less of foraging.  It was with
intense relief that they entered the Emperor's domains,
"for here," writes one of the travellers, "we believed
that we were in our own country; for we thought that
Alexios and his followers were our brothers-in-arms."
</p>

<p>
In this belief the troops of Raymond found themselves
mistaken, for they were harassed on all sides by the
Emperor's soldiers.  Alexios, as usual, disclaimed all
responsibility, and begged the Count to hasten to
Constantinople.  There, to his disgust, the old warrior
found that Godfrey, Bohemond, and the other leaders
had all taken the oath of fealty, and were very anxious
that he should follow their example.  This Raymond
emphatically refused to do.  "Be it far from me,"
said he to Alexios, "that I should take any lord for
this way save Christ only, for whose sake I have come
hither.  If thou art willing to take the cross also, and
accompany us to Jerusalem, I and my men and all
that I have will be at thy disposal."
</p>

<p>
Meantime came news to the Count that the army
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
he had left when he accepted the call to Constantinople,
had been attacked by the troops of the perfidious
Emperor, whose aim, possibly, was to frighten Raymond
into submission; but he had quite mistaken his man.
Furious at this treachery, Raymond called upon his
colleagues to join him in an attack upon the capital.
But here he met with unexpected opposition.  Bohemond,
indeed, went so far as to threaten that if an open conflict
took place, he would be found on the side of the Emperor,
and even Godfrey urged most strongly that he should
overlook everything rather than weaken their cause
by fighting against fellow-Christians.
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough, though Raymond accepted unwillingly
the advice of Godfrey, his upright character
and vigorous simplicity seem to have won the respect
and affection of the Emperor more than all the rest.
It is true that Raymond refused steadfastly to pay
him homage, "and for that reason," says the chronicler,
"the Emperor gave him few gifts"; but we read
in the record of the daughter of Alexios, who gives us
a vivid account of this period, "One of the Crusaders,
Count Raymond, Alexios loved in a special way, because
of his wisdom, sincerity, and purity of life; and also
because he knew that he preferred honour and truth
above all things."
</p>

<p>
By this time such remnants of the army as had
lingered in Italy under Robert of Normandy, together
with all that was left of the rabble led by Peter the
Hermit, had joined the main body of the Crusaders
and were ready to advance upon the Turkish stronghold
of Nicæa.
</p>

<p>
The full array of the armies of the First Crusade,
before they were decimated by war and famine, must
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
have constituted a truly overwhelming force.  Their
number must have been about six hundred thousand;
in the words of the daughter of Alexios, "all Europe
was loosened from its foundation and had hurled itself
against Asia."  The horsemen wore coats of mail, with
pear-shaped shields, each with its own device, and
carried a long spear and short sword or battle-axe.
The foot-soldiers bore the cross-bow or long-bow, with
sword, lance, and buckler.  "They were covered,"
says a Saracen historian, "with thick strong pieces of
cloth fastened together with rings, so as to resemble
dense coats of mail."
</p>

<p>
Such was the appearance of the host which now
marched upon the stronghold of Nicæa to begin a
siege which is memorable for the light it throws upon
the despicable character of the Emperor Alexios.
</p>

<p>
When the Crusaders first drew near to the city,
says one of them, "the Turks rushed to war, exultingly
dragging with them the ropes wherewith to bind us
captive.  But as many as descended from the hills
remained in our hands; and our men, cutting off their
heads, flung them into the city, a thing that wrought
great terror among the Turks inside."
</p>

<p>
After this defeat the Sultan David deserted the city
and hastened away to rouse his countrymen to give
active help at this crisis; and the Crusaders, much
encouraged, renewed the siege.  The great obstacle
to success was the fact that the city was protected on
the west by a lake, which made it impossible to surround
the walls.  Aid was sought of Alexios, who sent boats
from which skilful archers poured their arrows against
the ramparts.  It was evident that these must very
shortly fall.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
</p>

<p>
Knowing this to be the case, the Emperor sent a
secret envoy to offer the Turks better terms than could
be expected from the Crusaders, if they would give
up the city to him.
</p>

<p>
Hence, just as the latter were preparing to make
their last assault, they saw, with a disappointed fury
that can be imagined, the Imperial flag floating from the
citadel.  The glory and the spoils of victory were both
with Alexios, and though he tried to smooth the
matter over by lavishing gifts upon the Crusaders, the
feelings of the latter were truly expressed by Count
Raymond when he said, "Alexios has paid the army
in such wise, that, so long as ever he lives; the people will
curse him and declare him a traitor."

The Siege of Antioch

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The city of Antioch, capital of Syria, towards
which the faces of the Crusaders were now set,
was one of the most famous and beautiful
cities of the East.  Behind it lay the rugged ranges of
Lebanon; part of its wide girdle of walls and turrets was
washed by the river Orontes, towards which sloped
gardens fragrant with roses; and it was intersected by
a spacious street adorned with double' colonnades.  But
it was yet more famous for its associations with St
Peter, its first bishop, and for having been the birthplace
of St Chrysostom, "the golden-mouthed" teacher of
Eastern Christendom.
</p>

<p>
A few days after the march from Nicæa to Antioch
had commenced, the great army divided itself into two
parts, one led by Raymond, Baldwin, and Godfrey; the
other by Bohemond, Tancred, and Robert of Normandy.
This division suited the plans of the Sultan David, who,
since the fall of Nicæa, had been watching operations
from the surrounding heights.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
</p>

<p>
No sooner was Bohemond's army seen to halt for
rest and refreshment beside a river, than, with a terrific
uproar, thousands of Turks hurled themselves upon them
from the heights above.  Hasty messages were sent to
summon the other army, and meantime the Crusaders
fought with desperate valour.
</p>

<p>
"Even the women were a stay to us, for they carried
water for our warriors to drink, and ever did they
strengthen the fighters."
</p>

<p>
The numbers of the foe were overwhelming, however,
and only the courage and energy of the leaders prevented
a panic-stricken flight.  The tact of Robert of Normandy,
who, at a critical moment, snatched off his helmet and
cheered on his men in the thick of the fight, is said to
have turned the scale of victory.  Even then success
seemed hopeless, but just as evening drew rapidly on,
the second army came upon the scene.  Seeing this, the
Sultan fled, and many of his followers with him, but he
left behind so rich a spoil of gold, jewels, silks, and other
luxuries, that it was with difficulty the victors were
induced to leave the booty and resume their march
without too much encumbrance.
</p>

<p>
Such was the first pitched battle between the
Crescent and the Cross, of which one of the combatants
writes: "Had not the Lord been with us, and sent us
speedily another army, not one of our men would
have escaped."
</p>

<p>
And now the Crusaders were free to pass on to Antioch,
though the march thither probably cost them more
lives than did that battle of Dorylæum.
</p>

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-083.jpg" alt="Robert of Normandy at Dorylæum" />
<br />
<i>Robert of Normandy at Dorylæum</i>
</p>

<p>
The heat of the desert wastes during the month of
July left many prostrate by the wayside, never to rise
again.  Terrible thirst tormented them, and the sight of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
a welcome stream was the signal for such excesses of
drinking that both men and horses died by hundreds.
</p>

<p>
It was almost impossible to obtain food, for the son of
Sultan David had marched before the Crusading host,
destroying all supplies and leaving the towns upon the
track empty and famine-stricken.
</p>

<p>
At length the fertile district of Cilicia was reached, and
relief was obtained from these woes.  But here arose
those unfortunate dissensions which were a lamentable
feature both in this and later Crusades.
</p>

<p>
Meantime Tancred and Baldwin with a part of the
army had pushed on to Tarsus.  This city, the birthplace
of St Paul, though held by a small band of Turks, was
largely inhabited by Christians, who eagerly claimed
Tancred as their protector and lord.  Just as the Turks
were about to surrender to him, the forces of Baldwin,
who had been exploring elsewhere, appeared on the
distant heights, and being mistaken by the Turks for
their allies, encouraged them to delay giving up the city.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of the new-comer before the walls gave rise
to a quarrel with Tancred, the heat of which was only
intensified by the discovery that the unscrupulous Baldwin
was busy intriguing with the inhabitants with the object
of winning their allegiance.
</p>

<p>
In disgust, Tancred, the weaker but more upright
of the two, left him to take possession of the city and
marched to Messis.  But thither, too, the grasping
Baldwin followed, and the sight of his tents pitched beneath
the walls was the signal for a conflict between the two
hosts of Crusaders which reflects little credit on either
side.
</p>

<p>
Finally, since reconciliation was impossible, Baldwin
gladly accepted an invitation from the famous Armenian
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
city of Edessa to take up its cause against the Turks.
The prince adopted him as his son, and was ill rewarded
by a rebellion of his people in favour of the new-comer,
which soon cost their ruler his life.  Thus, while the
main army was pressing on to Antioch, Baldwin, married
to an Armenian princess, was busy in establishing in
Edessa the first Latin kingdom of the East.
</p>

<p>
On October 21st, 1097, the host of the Crusaders at
length encamped around the walls of Antioch and made
their preparations in anticipation of an early victory.
The gates, however, were blocked by huge masses of
rock from neighbouring quarries, and it seemed an easier
task to break the walls than to force the gates.
</p>

<p>
But both proved to be impossible, even with the aid of
a new instrument of war, a huge tower, the outcome of
great toil and expense, which, full of troops, was wheeled
against one of the gateways.  This proved a failure
before the showers of Turkish arrows, and was burnt to
ashes as it stood.
</p>

<p>
Three months of fruitless effort passed, and the host
of the Crusaders began to suffer from lack of food.  They
dared not venture far to look for it, for the Turks were
always on the watch, and no man could with safety
leave his post.
</p>

<p>
Finding, moreover, that the Crusaders generally got
the worst of it when the Turks made a sally from the
city, the native Christians of the country transferred the
provisions they had been wont to bring to the former, to
those from whom they now believed they would reap
the greater advantage in the near future.
</p>

<p>
Then hope began to fail the besiegers, whose camp,
owing to the heavy rain, had now become a fever-haunted
swamp.  One or two of the meaner-spirited leaders
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
tried to get quietly away with their troops; even Peter
the Hermit lost heart, and would have deserted the host
had he not been forcibly turned back by Tancred.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the Seljukian Turks had been expelled by
the Saracens from Jerusalem and Tyre, and the Caliph of
the latter now sent envoys to the leaders of the Crusade,
of whose evil condition he had been informed, to
express his surprise that the Christians, while rightly
warring against the fierce Seljuks, should desire to attack
Jerusalem also.  He promised, moreover, to extend his
protection for a whole month to any peaceable pilgrims
who should wish to visit the Holy City, on condition that
the Crusaders would acknowledge his supremacy in
Syria; and he warned them that if they refused his terms
his whole power would forthwith be directed against them.
</p>

<p>
The Caliph's envoys expected to find the camp in sorry
plight; but, to their surprise, they were entertained in
lordly fashion, and found every sign of prosperity and
plenty.  They were sent back with an absolute refusal
to relinquish the right of Christendom over the whole of
Palestine, and quite in ignorance of the terrible straits
in which the army really stood, in spite of its outward
appearance of prosperity.  It was true that when the
enemy attacked them in the open, the Crusaders were
more than able to hold their own; it was the hopeless
inaction, the dread of disaffection in the camp, and the
pangs of actual famine that were sapping the courage of
the besiegers; and now the news that an immense army,
led by the Sultan of Persia, was coming to the relief of
the city was the last and most crushing blow.
</p>

<p>
At this crisis, Bohemond, whose movements had for
some time been full of mystery, assembled the leaders
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
and asked for a solemn oath from them that the man who
succeeded in taking the city should be its future ruler.
Very unwillingly they gave their consent, upon which
Bohemond revealed the fact that he had for some time
past been in communication with an officer of the city
guard, who was in the full confidence of the governor, and
could obtain possession of Antioch whenever he wished.
</p>

<p>
So, on the 2nd of June 1098, nearly six months after the
beginning of the siege, a little band of Crusaders quietly
approached the gate of St George and gave their signal.
A rope ladder was silently lowered from the top of the
wall, up which Bohemond promptly sprang.  But at the
summit he found himself alone; for in their distrust of
him, the rest had waited to see what would happen.  The
sight of his safe arrival gave them confidence, and about
sixty swarmed up the ladder, which then broke.  Those
at the top, however, undeterred by their isolated position
on the walls of a hostile city, found their way in the
darkness to a gate, and broke it open.  In rushed the
invading army with their battle-cry of "Deus vult!
Deus vult!" and the city, taken quite unawares, was
soon in their hands.
</p>

<p>
The sun rose on the third day of June upon a city red
with blood, the governor of which had paid with his head
for his courage in holding out so long.  Dawn also
revealed the blood-red banner of Bohemond floating from
the highest tower.  Only the citadel, by a strange
oversight on the conqueror's part, was still in the hands of a
small body of Turks.
</p>

<p>
The news of the fall of Antioch gave rise to general
alarm throughout the East.  The followers of Sultan
David, their former foe, joined with those of the Sultan
of Persia against the Crusaders, and led by the famous
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
general Kerboga, flung themselves against the walls
of the city.  Flushed with success, the victors had
overlooked the fact that there was scarcely any food within
the gates, and also they had allowed their means of
access to the Mediterranean ports to be cut off.  Within
a few days the besiegers were the besieged and in far
worse plight than before.  Many, even of the nobles,
were seized with panic, and letting themselves down by
ropes from the walls, fled to the sea-coast.  Even
Stephen of Chârtres, son-in-law of William the Conqueror,
who, through illness, had retired before the city fell, and
who was now entreated to return with his troops to its
aid, lost his nerve when he looked down from the hills
upon the sea of tents that lay before the walls.  Not only
did he rapidly retreat, but meeting the Emperor Alexios
marching with an army to aid the Crusaders, he actually
prevailed upon the latter, not at all against his will, to
retire from the hopeless conflict.
</p>

<p>
With foes outside the walls, and foes holding the
citadel within, the unfortunate host of Crusaders was
indeed in evil case.
</p>

<p>
"We who remained," writes one, "could not hold out
against the arms of those within the castle, so we built
a wall between ourselves and them, and watched it day
and night."
</p>

<p>
Despair led to loss of nerve and discipline; many of the
soldiers refused to bear arms or even leave their abodes,
and had to be "burnt out" by the orders of Bohemond.
The destruction of a great part of the city to which this
inadvertently led, did not improve matters.
</p>

<p>
The situation was relieved at this apparently
hopeless juncture in a most remarkable manner.  Into the
midst of the council at which the chiefs were hurriedly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
considering what could best be done to prevent further
demoralisation, appeared a certain priest, Peter
Barthelemy, chaplain to Raymond of Toulouse, who
declared unto them a marvellous dream or vision.  He
had, he said, been carried in his sleep by St Andrew to
the Church of St Peter within the city, and had been
shown there the head of the lance which had pierced the
sacred side of the Saviour.  This, the saint had told him,
if borne at the head of the army, was certain to bring
them success.
</p>

<p>
Great was the power of religious faith in those days.
Whether the story was true, or merely a device to drive
out panic and awaken enthusiasm, matters not; the
effect remains the same.  Marching in solemn procession
to the Church of St Peter, they made excavations at the
spot indicated, at first with no success.  Then as the dusk
began to fall, Peter the priest himself descended
barefooted and dressed only in a tunic, and after digging for
some time, declared with a joyful shout that the sacred
relic was discovered.
</p>

<p>
"At last," says the historian, "seeing that we were
fatigued, the young man who had told us of the lance
leapt into the pit, all ungirt as he was, without shoes, and
in his shirt.  He adjured us to call upon God to render
us the lance for our comfort and our victory.  At last
the Lord, moved by such devotion, showed us the lance.
And I, who have written these things, as soon as ever
the blade appeared above ground, greeted it with a kiss,
nor can I tell how great joy and exultation then filled
the city."
</p>

<p>
Such was the effect of this discovery, that, in their
certainty of victory, the Crusading chiefs forthwith
sent a message to Kerboga, offering him a chance of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
withdrawal before he was utterly demolished.  Peter the
Hermit was the chosen ambassador, who, in spite of the
courteous hospitality with which he was received, so
disgusted the leaders of the host of Islam by his
haughtiness and insolence, that no such peaceful arrangement
could be entertained.  "So much the better," said the
rank and file, who were now as keen to fight as they had
before been to escape.  And so, very early on a perfect
June morning, the army marched out through the rose-scented
air in twelve battalions, according to the number
of the twelve apostles, led by Bishop Adhemar with the
Holy Lance held on high.
</p>

<p>
Some say that Kerboga was taken by surprise, others
that he welcomed the opportunity, long hoped for, of
drawing them into the open plain, and that he had
planned to surround them from the rear, and cut them off
from the city.  However that may have been, a desperate
struggle now began, which, from the overwhelming
numbers of the foe, must in the ordinary course have
gone against the Crusaders, weakened as they were by
want of food.  But it was the old story of the victory
of mind over matter.
</p>

<p>
When Adhemar, deserted by Godfrey and Tancred,
who had been summoned to the aid of Bohemond,
hard pressed by David the Sultan, found himself
surrounded by the dark face of the infidel, the sight of the
Holy Lance moved his handful of followers to fight with
such desperate valour, that for a moment the foe fell
back.  Raising his eyes to the encircling mountains, the
Bishop saw, or thought he saw, three radiant figures
riding upon milk-white horses to their aid.
</p>

<p>
"Behold, soldiers, the succour that God has provided
for you!" he cried, and at once a shout went up from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
all parts that St George, St Theodore, and St Maurice had
come to their help.
</p>

<p>
"Deus vult!  Deus vult!" they cried, and Islam
shrank before the extraordinary enthusiasm of their
attack.
</p>

<p>
The story of the battle is a monument to religious
faith, and illustrates in a wonderful way what miraculous
deeds of valour can be wrought under its influence.
</p>

<p>
Ere long the Turks fled in confusion to the mountains,
leaving the ground strewn with the bodies of the slain.
</p>

<p>
"But us the Lord multiplied," says he who tells the
tale, "so that in battle we were more than they, and
returning to the city with great joy, we praised and
magnified God, who gave the victory to His people."
</p>

<p>
It is a pity that the sequel of the story fails to preserve
this high level of enthusiasm and devotion.  Had it been
possible to march directly to Jerusalem, such might have
been the case; but the burning heat of summer forbade
such a course.  Left idle in Antioch, the soldiers grew
mutinous, and their leaders quarrelsome.  Bohemond
excited jealousy by his conquests of neighbouring cities.
Hugh of Vermandois deserted with his troops and
returned home.  A pestilence, caused by the thousands of
unburied bodies of the slain, fastened upon the Crusaders,
and claimed amongst its victims the good Bishop
Adhemar, the first to take up the Cross in the Holy War.
</p>

<p>
Not till January 1099 did the army march out towards
the South, leaving Bohemond behind as Governor of
Antioch.
</p>

<p>
It was upon this journey that Peter Barthelemy once
more became prominent by reason of many new visions
and dreams.  But his master, Count Raymond, was
unpopular at that time, and the occasion was seized by his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
opponents to accuse him indirectly of fraud in the matter
of the Holy Lance.  Whether this was true it is impossible
to say; but it must be remembered that Peter himself
never ceased to affirm his sincerity, and confidently
offered to go through the terrible Ordeal by Fire in proof
of the latter.
</p>

<p>
"Make me the biggest fire you can, and I will pass
through the midst with the Lord's Lance in my hand.
If it be the Lord's Lance may I pass through unharmed;
if not, may I be burnt up."
</p>

<p>
A vast crowd of Crusaders gathered to witness the
ordeal early on the morning of Good Friday.  Peter, clad
only in his tunic, passed fearlessly through the midst of
two blazing piles of dead olive branches, a foot apart
from one another.  "God aid him!" cried a thousand
throats, and when he emerged, apparently unhurt, a
thousand hands were stretched out to feel his limbs and
flesh.  For the moment faith again seemed to have
triumphed, and the followers of Raymond rejoiced.  But
presently it was seen that the unhappy priest was in
terrible suffering, some say from burns, others from the
too eager handling he had received from the crowd.
He died a few days later, confident in his honesty to the
last, and leaving those who had scoffed and those who
had believed exactly in the same frame of mind.
</p>

<p>
Yet this much attacked and possibly deluded priest had
done an important work; for, as far as we can see, the
Holy War would have come to an abrupt end during
the latter part of that remarkable siege of Antioch, had it
not been for the almost miraculous spirit of zeal and
devotion aroused by his alleged discovery.

CHAPTER VIII
<br />
The Holy City is won
</h3>

<p class="intro">
<i>Jerusalem, through the clear atmosphere, rising out of the deep
umbrageous valleys which surround it,
is reflected in a fiery splendour in the
morning sunlight</i>.  FARRAR: <i>Life of Christ</i>.
</p>

<p class="intro">
<i>Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem!</i>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSALM cxxii.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was with high hearts that the remnant of the
crusading host, now much reduced, took the road
to the Holy City, the end of all their endeavours.
With little difficulty they made their way along the
smiling plain of the River Orontes, and then keeping
close to the coast line between the mountains of
Libanus and the sea, passed through the famous
cities of Tyre, Sidon, and Joppa.
</p>

<p>
From the last of these they turned inland, and taking
possession of the little town of Ramleh, supposed to be
the burial place of St George, the patron saint of England,
the leaders held a council to consider their next
movements.
</p>

<p>
Those who cared most for the mere worldly success of
the undertaking were now strongly of opinion that they
should leave Jerusalem untouched for the present, and
attack the true centres of the power of Islam, Babylon
and Alexandria.  Others reminded these men of the real
object of the Crusades, and asked scoffingly how they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
hoped to seize great and populous cities if they could
not first capture the little town of Jerusalem.  The
worldly-minded gave way, but consoled themselves by
capturing villages and farms on the route of march.  The
rest, more serious minded, "set their faces steadfastly to
go towards Jerusalem."  "And those to whom the
Lord's command was dearer than lust of gain, advanced
with naked feet, sighing heavily for the disdain that the
others showed for the Lord's command."
</p>

<p>
Whilst resting at Emmaus at nightfall of June 6, 1099,
a little band of Christians living at Bethlehem crept into
the camp and told the leaders a doleful story of the
cruelty and oppression of Islam.  The information that
the birthplace of the Lord was near at hand quickened
every pulse.  Sleep was forgotten, and a hurried march
begun which brought them in a few hours to the top of
Mount Mizpeh, whence, with swelling hearts, they
watched the sun rise upon the sacred walls of the Holy
City.
</p>

<p>
"Jerusalem!  Jerusalem!"
</p>

<p>
The cry, restrained and reverent, filled the morning air,
as the great host fell prostrate and kissed the hallowed
soil.
</p>

<p>
By its natural position the city was exceedingly
difficult to take by assault, for it stood upon a rocky
plateau, guarded by the two steep valleys of Kedron
and Hinnon.
</p>

<p>
It was, moreover, defended by about forty thousand
picked Saracen warriors&mdash;a band equal in number to that
of the besiegers, but possessing far greater advantages
as to position and supplies.
</p>

<p>
With the utmost confidence, however, the Crusaders
took up their posts.  Robert of Normandy being
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
stationed on the north, Godfrey of Bouillon and Tancred
on the west, while Count Raymond advanced to Mount
Sion on the south.
</p>

<p>
It was clear from the first assault that they had
undertaken no light task, and meantime the usual horrors of
famine and thirst made their appearance in the camp.
There was little shade in that region; the groves around
had been cut down to provide wood for the "machines
of war," and the chief water supply&mdash;a spring which
bubbled up every other day&mdash;was soon choked by the
corpses of men and beasts who had trodden one another
down in the wild attempt to obtain drink.
</p>

<p>
The springs further off had all been poisoned by the
Saracens, and when the supplies of fruit began to fail, it
seemed as though the army would never possess the
strength to attack the city again.
</p>

<p>
A still worse calamity was the quarrelling which now
broke out again among the leaders.  Tancred was
bitterly censured for having set up his banner over the
Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem, Raymond for
having taken to himself the post of honour on the sacred
Mount of Sion.  The rank and file, following the example
of their chiefs, gave themselves over to laxity,
disobedience, and personal feuds.
</p>

<p>
Once again it was necessary to invigorate the faith of
the Crusaders, and accordingly Peter the Hermit declared
that the dead Adhemar had appeared to him with words
of severe rebuke for the sins of the camp, and the promise
that the city should fall if the army would march
barefoot round it for the space of nine days.  A council was
summoned, at which the noble Tancred was the first to
make up a long-standing quarrel with Count Raymond;
a feeling of good-will and reconciliation was spread
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
abroad; and it was determined to make a fresh attempt
in a spirit of more fervid religious zeal.
</p>

<p>
On the 12th of July 1099, while the Saracens were
setting up crucifixes upon the ramparts, and insulting
their Christian foes by spitting and throwing mud upon
them, a solemn procession, fully armed, singing psalms
and litanies, made its way around the walls; and a
sermon preached from the Mount of Olives by Arnulf, the
future Bishop of Jerusalem, roused even the most
despondent to do his best for the cause of God.
</p>

<p>
On the next two days, Wednesday and Thursday,
assaults were made, but without much success.  On the
Friday the Crusaders, having been reminded that it was
the day of the Lord's Passion and Death, came to the
work with new vigour, "even the women and the
children," writes the historian, "were eager to do their
part on that field."
</p>

<p>
But when Count Raymond fought on the south of the
city it seemed as though success was hopeless.  His
wooden tower, which protected the archers, was burnt
by the throwing of flaming oil from the walls, and his
men were driven into utter confusion.  Suddenly, when
retreat seemed inevitable, a marvellous portent was
seen.  On the Mount of Olives, on the further side of the
city, appeared a knight in glittering armour, waving a
flaming sword over Jerusalem.  The rumour quickly
spread that it was St George come to the aid of the
Crusaders.  "Deus vult!  Deus vult!" they shouted,
and in the vigour of their assault the outer wall was won.
</p>

<p>
The explanation of the occurrence was soon clear.  At
the further side of the city the stone-slingers of Godfrey
of Boulogne had at length driven the Saracens from the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
ramparts.  Seizing and lowering the drawbridge, and
scrambling up the walls by scaling ladders, the Teuton
host, headed by Bernard of St Valery, leapt upon the
battlements.  A certain unknown knight waved his
sword in signal of victory from the top of Mount Olives,
and this had been the sign which put new heart into
Count Raymond's men.
</p>

<p>
At the very hour at which their Saviour breathed His
dying words upon the Cross, the red-cross standard was
first seen to float over the walls of the Holy City.
</p>

<p>
From the horrors of bloodshed that followed the
capture of Jerusalem we can but turn away in disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Such a slaughter of pagan folk had never been seen
or heard of; none know their number save God alone."
</p>

<p>
This wanton cruelty can indeed only be excused when
we remember that it was the firm belief of those days that
"whosoever killeth an infidel doeth God service."
</p>

<p>
After that scene of slaughter and violence the leaders
of the Crusaders walked, bareheaded and barefooted,
dressed in long white mantles marked with the red cross,
to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to offer thanks for
their success.  Amongst them stood Peter the Hermit,
the real moving spirit of the Crusade, in spite of his
mistaken zeal as a leader of men.
</p>

<p>
It is said that many of the Christian inhabitants of the
city recognised him as the unknown pilgrim who had
promised to rouse on their behalf the nations of the west,
and they clung to his raiment with tears of gratitude.  It
is the last glimpse we have of that enthusiastic personality,
and we may be content to leave him there, at the moment
when his great aim had been accomplished.

<br />
<i>The Storming of Jerusalem</i>
</p>

<p>
A week later a meeting of the chieftains was called to
elect a king of Jerusalem.  None were eager to obtain a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
post of honour so difficult to maintain, and most were
anxious to return to their own dominions.  The crown
was first offered to Robert of Normandy, who, "impelled
by sloth or fear, refused it, and so aspersed his nobility
with an indelible stain."  So writes an English chronicler
of his day, but it must be said in Robert's defence that,
even as it was, he had tarried too long to make good his
claim to the kingdom of England against his grasping
brother Henry, and that his fair dukedom of Normandy
stood in immediate peril from the same cause.
</p>

<p>
Finally, by universal consent, the crown fell to the lot
of Godfrey of Boulogne, in many respects the noblest
Crusader of them all.  But he, with characteristic
modesty, refused to wear a crown of gold in the place
where his Lord had worn a crown of thorns, and so he
was known only by the title of the Defender of the Holy
Sepulchre.  Some say that Count Raymond had previously
been offered the position of king, and had refused
to take it, hoping possibly that he might obtain the
honour without the full responsibility.  However this
might be, we find him, on Godfrey's acceptance, sulkily
retiring to the Tower of David, which stronghold had
been seized from the Saracens by his men.  At first he
refused to give it up, and when forced to do so, declared
with childish fury that he would go home at once.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the intelligence that a vast army of Egyptians
had gathered at Ascalon recalled men from such foolish
bickerings, and united them once more for a time against
the common foe.  Although outnumbered by ten to one,
the Crusaders were again victorious, for the enemy,
according to the account of an eye-witness, seemed
paralysed at the very sight of the Christians, "not daring
to rise up against us."  But this victory only served to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
fan the flame of the constant feud between Godfrey
and Raymond.  The latter had calmly accepted the
allegiance of the people of Ascalon on his own responsibility.
Godfrey naturally claimed the city as part of the
kingdom of Jerusalem.  Rumour accuses Raymond of
having given back the town to the Egyptians rather than
let it pass into the hands of Godfrey.  He was scarcely
pacified with the governorship of Laodicea, which was
handed over to him when the other chieftains returned to
Europe.  Of those who had so gallantly turned their
faces towards the East, Godfrey and Tancred remained
in Jerusalem, Bohemond was ruler of Antioch, Baldwin
of Edessa, Raymond of Laodicea.
</p>

<p>
The reign of Godfrey, first King of Jerusalem in all but
name, lasted for barely one year.  Gentlest of all the
Crusaders, save where the "infidels" were concerned, and
noblest of the knights of the chivalry of his age, he lived
long enough to win the respect, if not the affection, of
even the Moslem population of his kingdom, and to
settle the latter upon a system scarcely differing from
that of a feudal over-lordship in France or England.
</p>

<p>
His end came after an expedition undertaken to aid
Tancred further up the coast.  As he returned, he ate
some fruit at Jaffa sent him by the Saracen ruler of
Cæsarea.  Immediately afterwards he was seized by
sickness, and a rumour went round that the fruit had
been poisoned.  His one anxiety was now to return to
the Holy City he had loved, and for which he had fought
so well; and there he breathed his last in the July of
1100, and was laid to rest in the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre.
</p>

<p>
In spite of all the intrigues of the partisans of
Bohemond, the ambitious ruler of Antioch, the followers
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
of the late king would have none but Baldwin, his
brother, as his successor.  The latter, therefore, was
brought from Edessa, and became the first king, in name
as well as in deed, of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
Let us now glance for a moment at the fate of some of
those whose fortunes we have so far followed.
</p>

<p>
You will remember that among those who turned
recreant before the siege of Antioch was Stephen of
Blois, son-in-law of the Conqueror.  When he returned
to his wife Adela, she, with the blood of her father hot
in her veins, bade him return and fulfil his oath.  About
the same time that he again turned his face to the East,
a crowd of unruly Lombards, more eager for mere
adventure than for the cause of God, set out for the Holy
Land, and after a riotous sojourn at Constantinople,
crossed the Bosphorus.  There they were joined by
Count Stephen, who begged the Emperor Alexios to
furnish them with a guide to Jerusalem.  The latter at
once offered them Count Raymond, of stormy memory,
who was staying at Constantinople at the time.  With
him came the news that Bohemond of Antioch, over
confident, had fallen into an ambush whilst on a foraging
expedition, and was a prisoner in the hands of the
Saracens.
</p>

<p>
Association with Raymond for however brief a period
most assuredly resulted in a quarrel, and consequently
there was a sharp difference of opinion as to the most
advantageous route.
</p>

<p>
The Lombards would go across Asia Minor, rescue
Bohemond, and possibly attack Bagdad, the centre of
Moslem rule; whilst Count Stephen wished to follow
the original road by way of Antioch.
</p>

<p>
Raymond elected to side with the latter, and together
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
they set off upon a journey in which they were harassed
hour by hour by their foes.  The Lombards left without
a guide, decided to follow in the rear, and had decidedly
the worst of it, many of them being cut down by the
Turks, who lay in ambush along the road.  An engagement
with the latter went against the Christians, a panic
ensued, and, in the midst of the confusion, Raymond
and his men rode off, and returned by sea to Constantinople,
leaving his companions to their fate.  With
the utmost difficulty the remnant of the followers of the
unfortunate Stephen made their way in the same
direction.
</p>

<p>
After the usual recriminations were over, Count
Raymond found himself next involved with Duke
William of Aquitaine, who, with a great rabble of
followers, had been stirred up by the news of the taking
of Jerusalem, to seek high adventure in that quarter for
himself.  Other smaller expeditions followed, and
setting off from Constantinople, fell straight into the
hands of the Turks, who beset the track to the Holy
Land.  Of all these so-called Crusaders, barely one
thousand survived to reach Antioch in the spring of 1102,
and to make their way to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
Meantime Count Bohemond, having escaped from his
two years' captivity, had not only resumed his position
at Antioch, but had seized upon Raymond's territory of
Laodicea as well.  He was now the open and declared
foe of Alexios of Constantinople, who had done his best
to get the count into his hands by paying a huge
ransom&mdash;a ransom which Bohemond himself had outbidden,
and so won his freedom.  Leaving Tancred to rule for
him in Antioch, Bohemond now sailed to France, married
the daughter of Philip I., with whose assistance he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
invaded the territory of the Emperor with a large army.
Alexios, as usual, gave in and bribed him into a
pretence of alliance, but a year later, when Bohemond had
returned to Italy to gather fresh forces, death put an
end to his fiery hopes and ambitions.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, when Bohemond on his escape was once
more ruler of Antioch, Raymond, driven from Laodicea,
had, as we have seen, joined the so-called "Aquitainian
Crusade" for a time, and then set himself to win new
territory by besieging the town of Tripoli.  It is much to
his credit that though, as his historian puts it, "he might
have lived in abundance in his own land," he never ceased
to fight while there was land to be won for Christendom.
It is difficult, however, to avoid the suspicion that he was
largely influenced by desire to serve his own personal
ambitious ends.  With but three hundred companions,
Raymond attempted to carry on the siege of Tripoli;
and there, an old and worn-out man, he died by the
shores on which he had fought for the past six years.
</p>

<p>
The unfortunate Stephen of Blois had, meanwhile,
wiped off the stain of desertion by his death in battle on
the side of King Baldwin, against the Saracens; and
Tancred, after holding Antioch for three years subsequent
to the death of Bohemond, as regent for his little son,
died of a wound received in a conflict with the Moslem foe.
</p>

<p>
Thus, by the year 1112, the only survivor in the East of
that gallant band of crusading chieftains was Baldwin,
brother of Godfrey, now King of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
In his reign were firmly established those great Orders
of Knighthood, the Knights Templars and the
Hospitallers, and the whole "Kingdom of Jerusalem"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
was settled upon a stronger basis&mdash;a strength, however,
which was more apparent than real.  Baldwin was a
wise and skilful ruler, showing little of that mean and
treacherous spirit which had distinguished his earlier
career.  He died in 1118, after a reign of seventeen years.

MORRIS, <i>Marching.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The First Crusade, with all its errors and
shortcomings, may yet be counted as a success
so far as the rescuing of Jerusalem from infidel
hands was concerned.
</p>

<p>
The Second Crusade is one of the great failures of
history.  Yet the movement is associated with the name
of one of the most notable characters of his age, the monk
Bernard of Clairvaux.  Just as in the First Crusade, the
uneducated hermit, Peter, had appealed to the popular
feeling of Europe, and had stirred up the poor and
ignorant to do their best for the cause of God, so St
Bernard, himself the son of a noble house, made his
appeal first to the wealthy, to the crowned heads of
Europe and the flower of their knighthood, and afterwards,
by his zeal, his self-denying life, and his religious
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
faith, to all those amongst whom he had earned the
reputation of a saint.
</p>

<p>
During the years in which Bernard, as Abbot of
Clairvaux, was devoting his energies to raising the
standard of monastic life, affairs in the East had taken
a distinct turn for the worse.  The Saracens had grown
stronger as the Christians grew more slack and careless.
Baldwin III., a boy of thirteen, had come to the throne of
Jerusalem two years before the first preaching of the
Second Crusade, and held the reins of government with
a weak and nerveless hand.  A year after his accession,
the kingdom of Edessa, the first to be established by
Western Christendom in the East, had fallen into the
clutches of the dreaded Sultan Zeuzhi.
</p>

<p>
The loss of Edessa sounded a trumpet note of alarm
to the West.  The hard-won success of the First Crusade
was evidently trembling in the balance.  Something
must be done to establish and settle Christian dominion
of the Holy Land upon a much firmer basis.
</p>

<p>
There were other motives at work as well.  France,
torn by the constant quarrels between its feudal lords,
who only united with one another in order to defy their
sovereign, could not be pacified save by some pressing
call to arms outside.  But the immediate cause that led
the young French king Louis to take up the Cross was
the feeling aroused throughout the religious world of the
West by one desperate deed.
</p>

<p>
He was attacking the rebel town of Vitry, which cost
him so much trouble to quell, that, in revenge, he not
only destroyed the city, but set fire to a great church in
which over a thousand people had taken refuge.  The
cries of the victims and the reproaches of his subjects
combined to rouse the conscience of the king, who vowed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
to go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem as a penance for his
crime.
</p>

<p>
It was the Easter of 1146.  On the top of the hill that
overshadows the town of Vézelay, a wooden tower had
been hastily raised, with a high platform in front, on
which sat the beautiful proud Queen Eleanor amidst a
bevy of her ladies, and the young king with the great
cross upon his tunic.  Suddenly there appeared in the
midst of the gallant throng a thin pale-faced monk,
eager and bright-eyed, followed by three bishops of the
Church.  Presently a vast crowd, stretching far away
to the edge of the plain below the hill, was hanging
breathlessly upon the words of the famous Abbot of
Clairvaux, as, quietly at first, and then with the most
eloquent persuasion, be bade them go forth to drive the
unbeliever from the Holy Land.
</p>

<p>
A roar of enthusiasm arose from the multitude before
his words were done.
</p>

<p>
"Crosses!  Crosses!" cried the people; and when
Bernard had flung to them those which lay in a great
heap by his side, he tore up his own long robe to make
them more.
</p>

<p>
The vast multitude dispersed, with the solemn pledge
of Louis of France that, after one year of preparation,
the Second Crusade should march towards the East.
</p>

<p>
But Bernard's aim was not yet accomplished.  Conrad
of Germany, whose possessions in that land were
threatened on every side, held back from the Holy War.
The monk followed him from place to place, persuading
and threatening him in vain.
</p>

<p>
At length Conrad promised to give a definite answer
on a certain day, and on that occasion, when the Emperor
came to Mass, Bernard preached a sermon in which he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
described the Day of Judgment.  There Conrad was
depicted trembling before the judgment-seat as he was
called to account for his great riches and power.  "How
have I, thy Lord, failed in aught of My duty towards
<i>thee</i>, O man?" asks his Master.  In the breathless
pause that followed, the Emperor arose and cried aloud
with tears, "No longer will I be ungrateful.  I will
serve Christ and take up His Cross whenever He shall
call me!"
</p>

<p>
"Praise be to God!" shouted the assembled congregation,
rising to their feet, and before the service was ended,
Bernard had marked the King with the Cross, fastening
upon his breast the sacred emblem torn from a banner
from the high altar.
</p>

<p>
In the wave of enthusiasm that now swept over
France and Germany as St Bernard went from town to
town, preaching and exhorting, the women did not stand
aloof.  Queen Eleanor herself prepared to accompany
her husband, Louis, and with her went a crowd of fair
dames from France.  With Conrad, too, marched a
troop of women, bearing shields and swords, led by one
known as the "golden-footed dame."
</p>

<p>
The German army started first and, save for floods by
which some were drowned, and lack of discipline which
ruined more, reached Constantinople in comparative
safety.  But here the behaviour of the drunken German
soldiers, who wantonly destroyed the beautiful pleasure
gardens of the city, and showed themselves utterly
untrustworthy, created serious ill-feeling between
Conrad and the Greek Emperor Manuel.  The latter
succeeded in inducing Conrad to transfer his army
across the Bosphorus, on the promise that he would
provide them with guides through Asia Minor; but he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
had meantime determined secretly to betray the armies
of the West at the earliest opportunity.
</p>

<p>
The guides supplied by him were in the pay of the
Turkish Sultan of that region, and after leading the
unhappy men by dangerous roads and in wrong directions,
finally brought them to a barren plain, without
food or water, bordered by hills amongst which lurked
thousands of the enemy.  The guides then fled in the
darkness, leaving the army to cope with an enemy
whose sudden attacks and equally sudden disappearances
among the rocky hills gave the Crusaders little chance of
effective retaliation.  Wounded and dispirited, the
unfortunate Conrad at length turned back to Nicæa,
his starting-place in Asia Minor, taking with him barely
one-tenth of the army which had started from Germany.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, the treacherous Manuel had taken measures
beforehand with regard to Louis.  When the French
armies reached his territory they found every city closed
against them.  Even when provisions might be bought,
they were let down from the walls in baskets by the
Greeks.  This unfriendly spirit was not disregarded by
the French nobles and clergy, some of whom urged their
king to make war upon an Emperor whose cities were
not invulnerable, and who was said to be in league with
the Turks.
</p>

<p>
This, however, Louis steadfastly refused, and trusted
that his well-disciplined army would win the favour of
the Emperor&mdash;a favour that the Germans had certainly
not deserved.
</p>

<p>
It seemed, indeed, as though this might happen, for
when they drew near the city, a fine procession came
forth to meet the King, and to conduct him with honour
to the presence of the Emperor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
</p>

<p>
Before long "the two princes became as brothers."  Manuel
himself displayed to Louis the magnificent
buildings of his city, and described to him the victorious
march which Conrad, as he said, with his assistance, had
made through Asia Minor.  He offered the same aid in
the way of guides to Louis, if he and his barons would pay
the customary homage.
</p>

<p>
With high hearts the French started for Nicæa, but they
had not long encamped in that place when some ragged
and blood-stained fugitives brought the news of the
disaster to Conrad's troops.  At once Louis hastened
to meet his brother sovereign; "weeping, they fell upon
each other's neck," and agreed henceforth to keep
together and to aid one another.
</p>

<p>
In dread of fresh attacks and more treachery, they
turned from the beaten track, and passing along the
coast, came at length to Ephesus.  There a message
reached them from Manuel, possibly repentant of his
former treachery, to the effect that their further way
was blocked by a huge army of Turks.  Conrad, weak
with wounds, then determined to return for awhile to
Constantinople, but, acting on his advice, Louis, after
staying to rest his troops and to let them spend their
Christmas in a fertile valley hard by, moved on over the
frozen hills to the River Meander, the opposite bank of
which was lined with Turks.  For awhile both armies
marched along the banks of the river in parallel lines;
then Louis discovered a ford, and thereupon made
good his passage and inflicted a great defeat upon
the foe.
</p>

<p>
But a terrible obstacle now faced them some miles
beyond Laodicea; they found the way shut in by a steep
range of hills "whose summit appeared to touch the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
heavens, whilst the torrent at its base seemed to descend
to hell."
</p>

<p>
Sent forward to secure the pass, Geoffrey de Rancogne
struggled to the top, but instead of taking possession of
it, descended the further slope, and, oblivious of the fact
that the heights were thronged with Turks, bade his men
pitch their tents there.  The main army, thinking all was
well, followed them to the summit of the narrow pass,
where a tremendous precipice skirted the track.  Down
rushed the foe upon them, hurling them into the yawning
depths.  A large number of the Crusaders, pilgrims, who
were quite unarmed, blocked the way when Geoffrey
strove to return to the rescue; thousands of these were
massacred, and Louis himself only just managed to save
his life by scrambling up to a high rock, from whence his
well-made armour defied the arrows of his assailants.  For
a while they sought to drive him from his position, but,
not realising that he was the leader of the expedition, left
him at nightfall to his fate.
</p>

<p>
This awful disaster nearly ended the Second Crusade
there and then.  Rage against Geoffrey de Rancogne for
his error, and dismay at the slaughter of their
fellow-soldiers, put an end to discipline for the time.  It was
only with the utmost difficulty that Louis was able to
conduct a remnant of the army to the post of Attaleia;
the rest had perished either by famine or by the constant
attacks of the Turks upon their line of march.
</p>

<p>
At the coast it was hoped that the troops might be
taken to Antioch by sea, and an attempt was made
to arrange this with the Greeks who held the fort.
They, however, demanded an impossible sum for the
three days' voyage, and it was decided that the main
army must go by land, in charge of Greek guides, while
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
Louis and his barons crossed by sea.  First, however, the
King bargained to pay a large sum if the Greeks would
receive into the city, and care for the large number of
sick and infirm pilgrims; and this was readily promised.
There was no reliance to be placed, however, upon the
treacherous Greeks.  Scarcely had the king's ship set
sail than they betrayed the whole band of sick pilgrims
into the hands of the Turks, and soon afterwards led the
army also into the midst of the hordes of the infidel.  The
helpless misery of the victims touched the hearts even of
the Turks, who pitied them and gave them food, "and
therefore," says the historian, "many of the Christians
forsook their own religion and went over to the Turks.
O kindness more cruel than Greek treachery!  For,
giving bread, they stole the true faith....  God may
indeed pardon the German Emperor, through whose
advice we met with such misfortunes, but shall He pardon
the Greeks, whose cruel craft slew so many in either
army?"
</p>

<p>
Thus, by this twofold act of treachery, the Greeks, the
representatives of Eastern Christianity, practically put
an end to the Second Crusade.  It was no triumphal
entry that Louis of France made when, on reaching
Jerusalem, he passed through the streets behind priests
and bishops, who sang, "Blessed is he that cometh in the
name of the Lord."  He had come empty-handed, for the
bones of his troops were scattered on the hills and plains
of Asia Minor.

</p>

<p>
At Jerusalem Louis found that Conrad, travelling from
Constantinople by water, had preceded him with a fairly
numerous following.  Feeling that something must be
done towards fulfilling the aim with which they had set
out, the two sovereigns joined with the young king,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
Baldwin of Jerusalem, in an attempt to besiege Damascus,
still one of the most important cities of the Holy Land.
</p>

<p>
To this siege came the famous Knights of the Hospital
and the Temple, and the combined troops fought with
such success that the fall of the city seemed certain.
Moreover, since they were attacking it from a quarter
rich in orchards and springs, they had no fear of the
ever-dreaded famine that had wrought such havoc in
the First Crusade.
</p>

<p>
Then once again discord brought disaster.  Heated
discussions arose as to who should rule Damascus when it
was taken, and the suggestion that it should be given to
the Count of Flanders at once gave offence to the
"barons of Palestine,"&mdash;those who had inherited the
possessions of the First Crusaders.  They actually began
to enter into negotiations with the citizens of Damascus,
and, playing the part of traitors, persuaded Louis, Conrad,
and Baldwin that they would find the walls weakest at
the farther side of the city.  Falling into the trap, the
three kings moved their camp, and soon found themselves
cut off from all supplies of food and drink, and faced by
hopelessly strong fortifications.  So they gave up in
despair.  Conrad, in deep disgust, returned to Europe at
once; Louis, after a short stay at Jerusalem, returned to
France by sea, with a few wretched followers, in place of
the gallant army that had marched forth barely a year
before.
</p>

<p>
The utter failure of the Second Crusade&mdash;a failure which
left countless homes in Western Europe empty and
desolate&mdash;struck a heavy blow at the authority and
popularity of Bernard of Clairvaux.  He himself was
not slow to point out the cause.
</p>

<p>
"We have fallen on evil days," says he, "in which the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
Lord, provoked by our sins, has judged the world, with
justice indeed, but not with His wonted mercy.  The
sons of the Church have been overthrown in the desert,
slain with the sword or destroyed by famine," and he
goes on to say that this is due to allowing thieves and
murderers to take part in an attempt which only the
faithful and holy soul should be found worthy to make.
</p>

<p>
The chief result of the Crusade, as far as the Holy War
itself was concerned, was to weaken the position of the
Christians in that region; for as Fuller quaintly
remarks, "The Turks, seeing one citie both bear the brunt
and batter the strength of both armies, began to
conceive that their own fear was their greatest enemy; and
those swords of these new pilgrimes which they dreaded
in the sheath, they slighted when they saw them drawn,
and they shook off the awe which had formerly possessed
them of the strength of the Western Emperor."

CHAPTER X
<br />
The Loss of Jerusalem
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  <i>All Europe streaming to the mystic East:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on their sun-smit ranks<br />
  The dusky squadrons close in vulture-feast.</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PALGRAVE: <i>Visions of England.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Most famous of the Sons of Islam who fought
against Christendom is Saladin, the Saracen
general who made himself master of Egypt
in the days of Amalric, King of Jerusalem, and who was
destined in the near future to be the conqueror of the
Holy City.
</p>

<p>
The time was ripe for such a conquest, for the little
kingdom was torn by the jealousy and strife of two
deadly rivals, Raymond of Tripoli and Guy of Lusignan.
</p>

<p>
The former was for living at peace with the Saracens,
at least until the coming of a new Crusade should drive
the infidel from the borders of the land.  The latter,
moved by causes far other than religious enthusiasm,
was eager to fight at once, hoping thus to obtain the
upper hand over his wretched young brother-in-law,
Baldwin, the leper king.  With him was Reginald of
Châtillon, who had spent long years in Saracen dungeons,
and was furiously eager for revenge.
</p>

<p>
The quarrel between Raymond and Guy and their
adherents led directly to the Fall of Jerusalem, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
in the meantime the details are full of romantic
interest.
</p>

<p>
A certain Gerard, a knight of France, who had come to
the Holy Land merely to make his fortune, desired to
marry the Lady of Botron, a rich ward of Raymond of
Tripoli.  But Raymond, as was frequently the case in
those feudal days, had his own profit to make by the
marriage.  He scornfully rejected Gerard, and gave the
lady to a wealthy Italian merchant, who was glad to pay
for his wife her weight in gold.
</p>

<p>
In great wrath, Gerard left Tripoli, joined the Knights
Templars, and in due course became Grand Master of the
Order, and awaited his chance for revenge.  This came
in 1186, when both the leper and his little son were dead,
and Raymond was known to be desirous of occupying
the vacant throne.
</p>

<p>
Hurriedly summoning Sibylla, wife of Guy of Lusignan,
and sister of the leper king, to Jerusalem, Gerard and
Reginald of Châtillon caused the gates to be shut and the
walls guarded, so that none might come in or out.  But
amongst those inside was a spy sent by the watchful
Raymond, who managed to get into the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre, where he saw Sibylla sitting with two
crowns before her.  One of these was handed to her by
the Patriarch of Jerusalem, who said, "Lady, you have
been proclaimed queen, but since you are a woman, it is
good that you have a man to help you in your rule.
Take the crown you see before you and give it to him
who can best help you to govern your realm."
</p>

<p>
Then Sibylla beckoned to her husband, Guy, and placing
the crown upon his head as he knelt before her, said,
"Sire, take this, for I know not where I could bestow it
better."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
</p>

<p>
Then was Gerard, Grand Master of the Templars, heard
to murmur, "This crown is well worth the marriage
of Botron."
</p>

<p>
Thus did Guy de Lusignan become King of Jerusalem,
while Raymond of Tripoli, checkmated for the time,
could only refuse him his allegiance and retire in sullen
fury to his own city of Tiberias.  Rumour indeed
whispered that he was on no unfriendly terms with
Saladin himself.  But it was probably foresight as well
as a sense of justice which roused him to deep wrath when
Reginald of Châtillon, in time of truce, attacked a wealthy
caravan passing from Damascus to Egypt, and
"dishonourably carried off the merchants as prisoners,
together with all their baggage."
</p>

<p>
"The taking of this caravan," says the chronicler,
"was the ruin of Jerusalem," for from that time dates
the implacable hatred of Saladin for those who held the
city.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, urged on by Gerard, the Grand Master,
Guy of Lusignan, meanest and weakest of kings, sought
to gratify his personal spite against his former rival by
besieging Tiberias, and was only prevented by a warning
that this might mean an open alliance between Saladin
and Raymond against himself.
</p>

<p>
Raymond's patriotism, however, was greater than his
desire for revenge.  While absent from his own city
with his troops, he heard that the Saracens had crossed
the Jordan, and were advancing upon the Holy City.
Hastening to Jerusalem, he at once put himself and his
men at Guy's disposal in face of this pressing danger.
</p>

<p>
Meantime Saladin, probably in wrath at this action
of one whom he had hoped to make his ally, began to
besiege Tiberias; and a message arrived in Jerusalem
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
from Raymond's wife, begging that an army might be
sent to her aid.  A council was hurriedly summoned to
see what could be done to save the city; but Raymond,
to the surprise of all, was strongly of the opinion that
Tiberias should be left to its fate.
</p>

<p>
"Sire," said he, "I would give you good advice if you
would only trust me."  "Speak your mind and fear
nothing," they replied, whereupon he counselled them
not to send troops out of Jerusalem, even if this should
mean the loss of his own fortress.
</p>

<p>
"If I lose wife, retainers and city," said he, "so be it;
I will get them back when I can; but I had rather see
my city overthrown than the whole land lost."
</p>

<p>
Though much astonished by such disinterested advice,
the council agreed to follow it, and so dispersed.
</p>

<p>
But at dead of night there came secretly to the King
the mischief-maker Gerard, bidding him "reject the
counsel of this traitor count," and hinting that
Raymond's advice had been merely to further his own
ends.  Guy de Lusignan was so much in the hands of the
man who had made him king that he dared not refuse
to listen to him, and at daybreak the order was given
for the army to march out of Jerusalem in order to
relieve Tiberias.
</p>

<p>
In the terrible battle of Tiberias that followed, the
portents were all against the Crusaders.
</p>

<p>
"A fearful vision was seen by the King's chamberlain,
who dreamed that an eagle flew past the Christian army
bearing seven darts in its talons, and crying with a loud
voice, "Woe to thee, Jerusalem."
</p>

<p>
On a mound outside Tiberias had been placed a portion
of the True Cross, and round this the army of Guy, unable
to enter the city, rallied again and again as they were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
dispersed by the followers of Saladin.  But heat and
thirst played as much havoc as did the enemy, and at
close of day, the sacred relic itself, together with the King
and Reginald of Châtillon, the truce-breaker, fell into the
hands of the infidel.
</p>

<p>
It is said that Reginald's head was struck off in the
presence of Saladin, and possibly by his hand, in revenge
for his past perfidy.  Guy was thrown into prison, and
Raymond, who had made good his escape, died of grief
at the loss of all that he had held most dear.
</p>

<p>
Within two months of this battle of Tiberias, Saladin
was master of every important stronghold in the land,
save only Tyre and Jerusalem, and these were closely
besieged.
</p>

<p>
The Holy City was indeed in the most perilous condition,
for there were now no soldiers within the walls,
and no leader to look to in all the land, save only Balian
of Ibelin, and he was at this time a fugitive, who had
sought protection within the walls of Tyre.
</p>

<p>
Bereft of a leader, the city had well-nigh lost hope,
when Balian, acting apparently in good faith, begged
leave of Saladin to conduct his wife and family within
the walls of Jerusalem, promising that he himself would
stay there but one night, and then return to Tyre.
</p>

<p>
To this Saladin agreed; but when Balian was once
inside the city, the inhabitants refused to let him leave
it again.
</p>

<p>
The patriarch Heraclius, indeed, assured him that he
could not keep his promise without committing grave sin,
saying, "Great shame will it be to you and to your sons
after you if you leave the Holy City in this perilous strait."
</p>

<p>
So Balian remained and did his best, with only two
knights to aid him, and little enough of food to feed the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
multitudes who came in day by day from the country
round, and set up their tents in the streets of the
city.
</p>

<p>
"The priests and clerks," says Geoffrey de Vinsauf,
"discharged the duties of soldiers and fought bravely
for the Lord's House ... but the people, alike ignorant
and timorous, flocked in numbers round the patriarch
and the queen, bitterly complaining and earnestly
entreating that they might make terms of peace with the
Sultan as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
Even when the city was given up on condition that
Saladin would accept a ransom for the lives of the
inhabitants, there came small consolation to the
unhappy people.  For some thousands of them could pay
no ransom at all, and had nothing to hope for but the
miseries of slavery.
</p>

<p>
When this fact was known, it called forth all that
chivalry of the infidel chieftains upon which the
chroniclers love to dwell.
</p>

<p>
Saphadim, the brother of Saladin, and his right hand
during the siege, at once begged a thousand slaves as
his share of the booty.
</p>

<p>
"For what purpose do you desire them?" asked Saladin.
</p>

<p>
"To do with them as I will," replied his brother, upon
which the Sultan smiled and granted his request.
</p>

<p>
As he expected, the unhappy captives were at once
given their freedom.  Then the Patriarch and Balian,
who had been treated with the utmost courtesy, each
begged for seven hundred souls; and when those were
granted, Saladin said, "My brother has given his alms;
the bishop and Balian theirs.  Now will I give mine
also."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
</p>

<p>
With that he granted freedom to all aged folk within
the city, "and this was the alms that Saladin made."
</p>

<p>
Thus did Jerusalem fall once more into the hands of
Islam, and the Crescent shone again over the Holy City,
in which for eighty-eight years the Cross had reigned
supreme.

CHAPTER XI
<br />
The Story of the Third Crusade
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  <i>A goodly golden chain wherewith yfere<br />
  The virtues linked are in lovely wise<br />
  And noble minds of yore allyed were<br />
  In brave pursuit of chivalrous emprise.</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPENSER: <i>Faery Queene.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The news of the fate of Jerusalem moved
Western Europe to such horror and dismay
as had never before been known.  Everywhere
signs of mourning were seen; a general fast was ordered,
a fast which was kept to some extent, at least, by some
pious souls, until the Holy City was recovered; and
Pope Clement III. set himself to act the part of a St
Bernard by stirring the hearts of princes to take up the
Cross in a Third Crusade.
</p>

<p>
Of this Crusade it seemed at first as though the famous
Emperor Frederick Barbarossa was to be the leader,
though Philip of France and Henry II. of England were
not long behind him in accepting the Cross.
</p>

<p>
In both France and England, too, the "Saladin-tax"
became the custom&mdash;each man paying a tithe, or tenth
part of his income, for the maintenance of the expedition.
Everywhere the enthusiasm was so great, that it was only
necessary for a preacher to announce the Crusade as his
text to secure a vast and eager audience.  It mattered
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
nothing that his hearers did not even understand the
language in which he spoke&mdash;all alike were stirred to do
their part to win back what the First Crusaders, those
heroes of romance, had fought for and won.
</p>

<p>
But Henry of England was too fully occupied with the
treason of his sons in his old age to do more than make
promises of help, and at his death, it was one of the latter,
the famous Richard Lion-Heart, who became the leader
of the English Crusade, and finally of the whole
undertaking.  The Emperor Frederick, however, would not
wait for him, nor for the French king, but hurried off
on his toilsome journey at an age when most men would
be hoping for a period of fireside ease and rest before the
last long journey of all.
</p>

<p>
As usual the promises of the Greek Emperor, Isaac,
were not to be trusted, but the great army of Frederick
Barbarossa struck such terror into the hearts of Greek
and Turk alike, that he was able to move forward into
Cilicia with little hindrance.  But there, when bathing
his heated limbs in a little river among the hills, that
mighty Emperor, who had built up a famous Empire of
the West, perished and "came to a pitiful end."
</p>

<p>
The German host lost heart without their leader; many
died through famine, and of the remainder a small part
reached Antioch and placed themselves under the
command of its prince, the rest going on to Tripoli.
</p>

<p>
Meantime those two ill-assorted leaders, Richard of
England and Philip of France, had started on their way
to the East.  It was clearly hopeless from the first that
they would work together, for, while Richard was proud,
passionate, and irritable to a degree, Philip was cold
and crafty, and while Richard would eagerly make
amends for an injury done, and as readily forgive one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
done to him, Philip prided himself on never overlooking
an affront.  It was the quarrel of these leaders, rather
than the superiority of the armies of Islam, that made
the Third Crusade, as far as the taking of Jerusalem
was concerned, a complete failure.
</p>

<p>
They started, however, in apparent friendliness, and,
with many pledges of devotion, travelled together by a
new route by way of Marseilles.  From thence Philip
hurried on to Messina, in Sicily, but Richard's Crusaders
had deviated into Portugal to give help against the
Moors, and their impatient king set off alone in a small
ship, coasting along the shores of Italy, until his fleet
had caught him up, when he proceeded in great state to
join Philip at Messina.
</p>

<p>
The Crusaders stayed in Sicily for six months, by
no means in the character of friendly guests.  Tancred,
king of the island, had forced Joanna, the sister of
Richard, to become his wife; and she appealed to her
brother against him.  The latter promptly took up
her cause, but, with an eye to his own profit, offered to
give her up if Tancred would grant him a chair and table
of solid gold which formed part of her dowry.  On
Tancred's refusal, Richard at once attacked and took
Messina, which was only recovered by Tancred on
payment of forty thousand ounces of gold.
</p>

<p>
On the same March day that Philip at length sailed
for the Holy Land, Richard was betrothed to the
beautiful Berengaria of Navarre, and some ten days later
set off with her and his sister for the same destination.
But within two days a furious storm arose, which threw
two of his ships upon the coast of Cyprus.
</p>

<p>
Says Richard of Devizes, "Almost all the men of both
ships got away alive to land, many of whom the hostile
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
Cypriote slew, some they took captive, some, taking
refuge in a certain church, were besieged.  The prince
also of that island coming up, received for his share
the gold and the arms; and he caused the shore to be
guarded by all the armed force he could summon
together, that he might not permit the fleet that followed
to approach, lest the King should take again what had
been thus stolen from him....  But God so willed that
the cursed people should receive the reward of their evil
deeds by the hand of one who would not spare.  The
third English ship, in which were the women, rode out at
sea and watched all things, to report the misfortune to
the king.  A full report reached the King, who,
obtaining no satisfaction from the lord of the island, came in
arms to the port.  The King leaped first from his galley
and gave the first blow in the war, but before he could
strike a second, he had three thousand of his followers
with him striking away by his side....  The Cypriotes
are vanquished, the city is taken, and the lord of the
island is himself taken and brought to the King.  He
supplicates and obtains pardon; he offers homage to
the King, and it is received; and he swears, though
unasked, that henceforth he will hold the island of him
as his liege lord, and will open all the castles of the
land to him."
</p>

<p>
That same night, while Isaac of Cyprus was plotting
how to get rid of his new-made bonds, Guy of Lusignan,
the King of Jerusalem, who had been released by Saladin
on condition that he went into exile, landed on the
island to bring greeting to Richard.  On the next day
the faithless Isaac fled.  "The kings pursue him, the
one by land, the other by water, and he is besieged in
the castle.  Its walls are cast down by engines hurling
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
huge stones; he, being overcome, promises to surrender
if only he might not be put into iron fetters.
</p>

<p>
"The King consented to the prayers of the supplicant,
and caused silver shackles to be made for him.  The
prince of the pirates being thus taken, the King traversed
the whole island; and the whole land was subjected to
him, just like England."
</p>

<p>
Before he left his new domain, Richard was married
to Berengaria, his betrothed, and set off with her to the
Holy Land, accompanied by Guy of Lusignan.  Their
destination was Acre, which, ever since Guy had been
convinced by the clergy that his oath to Saladin was of
no binding nature, had been besieged by him.  When
Richard arrived, this siege had already lasted nearly
two years, and to a more cautious eye the cause of Guy
of Lusignan would have appeared by no means hopeful.
But there were other motives at work.  Conrad of Tyre
had flatly refused to admit Guy to his own city, now the
only Christian stronghold in Palestine, on the plea that
God had appointed him its ruler and that he meant to
remain so.  This laid the foundation of a fine feud
between the two princes; and the fact that Philip of
France had taken up the cause of Conrad was sufficient
reason for Richard to ally himself with his rival.
</p>

<p>
"So," says Richard of Devizes, "King Richard came
to the siege of Acre, and was welcomed by the besiegers
with as great joy as if it had been Christ that had come
again on earth to restore the kingdom of Israel.  The
king of the French had arrived at Acre first, and was very
highly esteemed by the natives; but on Richard's
arrival he became obscured and without consideration,
just as the moon is wont to relinquish her lustre at the
rising of the sun."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
</p>

<p>
In further explanation of this, he tells us how a certain
Henry, Count of Champagne, who had now used up the
whole of his store of provision and money, came to his
king, Philip of France, for relief.  The latter, trying to
take a mean advantage, offered him a large sum if he
would give up his rights over Champagne; to which the
Count replied, "I have done what I could and what I
ought; now I shall do what I am compelled by necessity.
I desired to fight for my king, but he would not accept
of me unless I gave up what is mine own; I will go to
him who will accept me, and who is more ready to give
than to receive."
</p>

<p>
Richard received him with the utmost kindness and
liberality, and his men, "at the report of so great a
largess, took King Richard to be their general and lord;
the Franks only who had followed their lord remained
with their poor king of the French."
</p>

<p>
This did not endear Richard any the more to Philip,
but for a while these private grudges were forgotten in
the assault upon the walls of Tyre.
</p>

<p>
"The King of the English, unused to delay," says
Richard of Devizes, "on the third day of his arrival at
the siege, caused his wooden fortress, which he had called
'Mate Grifon,' where it was made in Sicily, to be built
and set up; and before the dawn of the fourth day the
machine stood erect by the walls of Acre, and from its
height looked down upon the city lying beneath it, and
there were thereon by sunrise archers casting missiles
without intermission upon the Turks."
</p>

<p>
While the Kings of England and France were thus
engaged, Conrad and Guy were once again at variance.
With Philip's promise of support at his back, Conrad
now returned to Tyre and took no further part in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
siege.  The sultry heat of the plain then struck down
both Philip and Richard for awhile, but the recovery
of the former led to an assault which showed the
Saracens they had little hope of holding out, and
Richard, determined not to be outdone, struggled back
to the walls from his sick-bed, and struck them another
heavy blow.  Four days later a long procession of the
citizens filed out from the gates, bearing a flag of truce
and offering to surrender the city.  Richard was for
"letting the vanquished pay their heads for the ransom
of their bodies," but Philip, more politic as well as more
thrifty, held out for a ransom of two hundred pieces of
gold, the restoration of the True Cross which Saladin
had seized at the Battle of Tiberias, and the release of all
Christian captives.
</p>

<p>
So the two years' siege came to an end, but not without
a deed which blackens the name of Richard and Philip
for all time.
</p>

<p>
Saladin had delayed to furnish the ransom or to give
up the relics of the Cross; whereupon the King, who
was in name the follower of Him who taught His people
to love their enemies, had two thousand seven hundred
prisoners led to the top of a hill from which all that went
on could be seen in Saladin's camp; and there, at a
given signal, all these innocent followers of Mohammed
were cut down in cold blood.  Almost at the same time,
by the orders of Philip, nearly as many victims suffered
on the walls of the city itself.
</p>

<p>
The taking of Acre was the signal for a violent quarrel
between Richard, Philip, and Leopold, Duke of Austria.
</p>

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-133.jpg" alt="Richard and Philip at the Siege of Acre" />
<br />
<i>Richard and Philip at the Siege of Acre</i>
</p>

<p>
Richard Devizes tells the story thus.  "The Duke
of Austria, who was also one of the ancient besiegers
of Acre, followed the King of the English as though he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
would share in the possession of his portion; and because
his standard was borne before him, he was thought to
take to himself a part of the triumph.  If not by the
command, at least with the consent of the offended King,
the duke's standard was cast down in the dirt, and to his
reproach and ridicule, trampled under foot.  The duke,
though grievously enraged against the King, concealed
his wrath for a time, and betook himself that night to his
tent, which was set up again, and afterwards as soon as
he could, returned, full of anger, to his own country."
</p>

<p>
Heedless of the fact that "this quarrel might drink
blood another day," Richard next came into serious
collision with Philip of France.
</p>

<p>
"A certain Conrad, Marquis of Montferrat, a smooth-faced
man, had held Tyre, which he had seized on many
years ago, to whom the King of the French sold all his
captives alive, and promised the crown of the kingdom
of Jerusalem, which was not yet conquered.  But the
King of the English withstood him, Philip, to the face."
</p>

<p>
"It is not proper," said he, "for a man of your
reputation to bestow or promise what is not yet obtained;
and further, if the course of your journey be Christ, when
you have at length taken Jerusalem from the hand of the
enemy, you will, without delay or condition, restore the
kingdom to Guy, the lawful King of Jerusalem.  For
the rest, if you recollect, you did not obtain Acre alone,
so that neither should that which is the property of two
be dealt out by one hand."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, oh!" comments quaint Richard of Devizes,
"how pure for a godly throat!  The marquis, bereft
of his blissful hope, returns to Tyre, and the King of the
French, who had greatly desired to strengthen himself
against his envied ally by means of the marquis, now
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
fell off daily, and this added to the continual irritation of
his mind&mdash;that even the scullion of the King of the
English fared more sumptuously than the cupbearer of
the French.  After some time, letters were forged in
the tent of the King of the French, by which, as if they
had been sent by his nobles out of France, the King was
recalled to his own country."
</p>

<p>
And so Philip of France, amid oaths and protestations
of faith to Richard, sailed for Europe.  "How faithfully
he kept his oath the whole world knows.  For directly
he reached home, he stirred up the whole land and threw
Normandy into confusion.  What need for further
words!  Amid the curses of all, he departed, leaving his
army at Acre."

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Exactly two years after the siege of Acre had
commenced, the army of Richard, together with
the Knights of the Temple and the Hospital,
set out to conquer the territory that lay between the
mountains and the sea.
</p>

<p>
And "as the army marched along the sea-shore that
was in its right, all the while the Turks watched its
movements from the heights on the left."  The progress
of the Crusaders was therefore one long battle, and it was
further harassed by the natural difficulties of the road.
"That day," says Geoffrey de Vinsauf, an eye-witness
of these things, "the army moved forward with more
than wonted caution, and stopped, after a long march,
impeded by the thickets and the tall and luxuriant
herbage, which struck them in the face.  In these
maritime parts there were also a number of beasts of the
forest, who leapt up between their feet from the long
grass and thick copses."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
</p>

<p>
He tells us, moreover, of the touching device employed
to stir the hearts of the wearied soldiers, and to remind
them of the aim of their journey.
</p>

<p>
"It was the custom of the army each night before
lying down to rest to depute some one to stand in the
middle of the camp and cry out with a loud voice,
'Help!  Help! for the Holy Sepulchre!'  The rest of
the army took it up and repeated the words, and stretching
their hands to heaven, prayed for the mercy and
assistance of God in the cause.  Then the herald himself
repeated in a loud voice: 'Help!  Help! for the Holy
Sepulchre!' and everyone repeated it after him a
second and a third time.  The army," he adds naïvely,
"appeared to be much refreshed by crying out in this
fashion."
</p>

<p>
At length the preliminary skirmishes gave place to a
pitched battle, of which our eye-witness gives a spirited
account.
</p>

<p>
"On the Saturday, the Eve of the Nativity of the
Blessed Virgin Mary, at earliest dawn, our men armed
themselves with great care to receive the Turks, who
were known to have preceded their march, and whose
insolence nothing but a battle could check....  On that
day the Templars formed the first rank, and after them
came in due order the Bretons and men of Anjou; then
followed King Guy with the men of Poitou; in the fourth
line were the Normans and English who had the care of
the royal standard; and last of all marched the
Hospitallers: this line was composed of chosen warriors,
divided into companies.
</p>

<p>
"They kept together so closely that an apple, if
thrown, would not have fallen to the ground without
touching a man or a horse; and the army stretched from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
the army of the Saracens to the seashore.  There you
might have seen standards and ensigns of various forms,
and hardy warriors, fresh and full of spirits and well
fitted for war.
</p>

<p>
"King Richard and the Duke of Burgundy, with a
chosen retinue of warriors, rode up and down, narrowly
watching the position and manner of the Turks, to
correct anything in their own troops if they saw occasion.
</p>

<p>
"It was now nearly nine o'clock, when there appeared
a large body of the Turks, ten thousand strong, coming
down upon us at full charge, and throwing darts and
arrows, as fast as they could, while they mingled their
voices in one horrible yell.
</p>

<p>
"There followed after them an infernal race of men,
of black colour....  With them also were the Saracens
who live in the desert, called Bedouins; they are a
savage race of men, blacker than soot; they fight on
foot and carry a bow, quiver and round shield, and are a
light and active race.
</p>

<p>
"These men dauntlessly attacked our army.  They
came on with irresistible charge, on horses swifter than
eagles, and urged on like lightning to attack our men;
and as they advanced they raised a cloud of dust, so
that the sky was darkened.  In front came certain of their
admirals, as was their duty, with clarions and trumpets;
some had horns, others had pipes and timbrels, gongs,
cymbals and other instruments, producing a horrible
noise and clamour.  This they did to excite their spirits
and courage, for the more violent the clamour became
the more bold were they for the fray."
</p>

<p>
So hot grew the contest, and such was the inconvenience
suffered by the Crusaders because of their
narrow quarters between the foe and the sea, that there
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
was nothing for it but to retreat.  This of course brought
the full force of the attack upon the Hospitallers, "the
more so," says Geoffrey, "as they were unable to resist,
but moved forward with patience under their wounds,
returning not even a word for the blows which fell upon
them, and advancing on their way because they were not
able to bear the weight of the contest.
</p>

<p>
"A cloud of dust obscured the air as our men marched
on; and in addition to the heat, they had an enemy
pressing them in the rear, insolent and rendered
obstinate by the instigation of the devil.  Still the
Christians proved good men, and secure in their
unconquerable spirit, kept constantly advancing, while the
Turks threatened them without ceasing in the rear;
but their blows fells harmless upon the defensive armour,
and this caused the Turks to slacken in courage at the
failure of their attempts, and they began to murmur in
disappointment, crying out in their rage 'that our
people were of iron and would yield to no blow.'
</p>

<p>
"Then the Turks, about twenty thousand strong,
rushed again upon our men pell-mell, annoying them in
every possible manner, when, as if almost overcome
by their savage fury, Brother Gamier, one of the
Hospitallers, suddenly exclaimed with a loud voice,
'O excellent St George!  Will you leave us to be thus
put to confusion?  The whole of Christendom is now on
the point of perishing, because it fears to return a
blow against this impious race.'"
</p>

<p>
The King, however, had determined that no charge
should be made until the army had, by retreat, obtained
a better position for so doing.  So, even when the Grand
Master of the Hospitallers went to him, and said, "My
lord the king, we are violently pressed by the enemy,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
and are in danger of eternal infamy, as if we did not dare
to return their blows.  We are each of us losing our
horses one after another, and why should we bear with
them any further?"  The King replied, "Good Master,
it is you who must sustain their attack; no one could
be everywhere at once."
</p>

<p>
"On the Master returning, the Turks again made a
fierce attack upon them from the rear, and there was not
a prince or count among them but blushed with shame
and said to each other, 'Why do we not charge them at
full gallop?  Alas!  Alas! we shall for ever deserve
to be called cowards, a thing which never happened to
us before, for never has such a disgrace befallen so great
an army, even from the unbelievers.  Unless we defend
ourselves by immediately charging the enemy, we shall
gain everlasting scandal, and so much the greater
the longer we delay to fight.'"
</p>

<p>
In spite of these protests, they had all come to the
conclusion that the King was right in not ordering them
to charge till all were in a more advantageous position,
when "the success of the affair was marred," says
Geoffrey, "by two knights who were impatient of
delay."  Fortunately, Richard, seeing the mistake in time, gave
the order, "Prepare to charge!" forthwith.  "The sky
grew black with the dust that was raised in the
confusion of that encounter.  The Turks who had purposely
dismounted from their horses in order to take better
aim at our men with their darts and arrows, were slain
on all sides in that charge.  King Richard, on seeing
his army in motion and in encounter with the Turks, flew
rapidly on his horse through the Hospitallers who had
led the charge, and to whom he was bringing assistance
with all his retinue, and broke into the Turkish infantry,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
who were astonished at his blows and those of his men,
and gave way to the right and to the left."
</p>

<p>
A terrific fight ensued, ending in a triumph for the
Crusaders in so far that they had scattered the foe and
were able to proceed upon their march in safety.
</p>

<p>
In equally vivid phrase Geoffrey describes the anger
of Saladin when the news reached him of this defeat.
Bitterly did he reproach and deride his men, while his
"admirals" listened with heads bowed down.  At last
one bolder than the rest made answer, "Most sacred
Sultan, saving your Majesty, this charge is unjust, for
we fought with all our strength and did our best to
destroy them.  We met their fiercest attacks, but it was
of no avail.  They are armed in impenetrable armour
which no weapon can pierce so that our blows fell as it
were upon a rock of flint.  And further, there is one
among their number superior to any man we have ever
seen; he always charges before the rest, slaying and
destroying our men.  He is the first in every enterprise,
and is a most brave and excellent soldier; no one can
resist him or escape out of his hands.  They call him
<i>Melech Ric</i> (King Richard).  Such a king as he seems
born to command the whole earth; what then could we
do more against so formidable an enemy?"
</p>

<p>
Such is the description which Geoffrey, in his
hero-worship, puts into the mouth of the vanquished leaders
of the Saracens, and Saladin, no longer making light of
the danger that threatened his realm, promptly destroyed
all his more important fortresses, such as Joppa and
Ascalon, for fear <i>Melech Ric</i> should occupy them.
</p>

<br />
<i>Richard of England utterly defeats Saladin</i>
</p>

<p>
Richard himself was now very anxious to get possession
of Ascalon, and to re-fortify the walls.  But on this
point opinions were divided.  The French were, as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
usual, violently opposed to him, and wanted rather to
rebuild the fort of Joppa, "because it furnished a shorter
and easier route for pilgrims going to Jerusalem," and
the feeling of the multitude was with them.
</p>

<p>
"Foolish counsel; fatal obstinacy of those indolent
men!" comments Geoffrey.  "By providing for their
immediate comfort and to avoid labour and expense, they
did what they would afterwards repent of, for had they
then saved Ascalon from the Turks, the whole land
would soon have been clear of them.  But the cry of the
people prevailed, a collection was made, and they
immediately began to rebuild the towers, and to clear
out the moat of Joppa.  The army remained there long,
enjoying ease and pleasure ... and the whole people
became corrupted; the zeal of pilgrimage waxed cold,
and all their works of devotion were neglected."
</p>

<p>
It was about this time that an adventure befel King
Richard which nearly put an end to his career as leader
of the Third Crusade.
</p>

<p>
"About this time," says Geoffrey, "King Richard
went out hawking with a small escort, intending, if he
saw any small body of Turks, to fall upon them.
</p>

<p>
"Fatigued by his ride, he fell asleep, and a troop of the
enemy rushed suddenly upon him to make him prisoner.
The King, awakened by the noise, had barely time to
mount his bay Cyprian horse, and his attendants were
still in the act of mounting, when the Turks came upon
them and tried to take him; but the King, drawing his
sword, rushed upon them, and they, pretending flight,
drew him after them to a place where there was another
body of Turks in ambush.  These started up with speed,
and surrounded the King in order to make him prisoner.
The King defended himself bravely, and the enemy drew
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
back, though he would certainly have been captured if
the Turks had known who he was.
</p>

<p>
"But in the midst of the conflict, one of the King's
companions, William de Pratelles, called out in the
Saracen language that <i>he</i> was the "Melech," <i>i.e.</i> the
King; and the Turks, believing what he said, led him
off captive to their own army.
</p>

<p>
"At the news of this action our army was alarmed,
and seizing their arms, came at full gallop to find the
King, and when they met him returning safe, he faced
about and with them pursued the Turks, who had carried
off William de Pratelles thinking they had got the King.
They could not, however, overtake the fugitives, and
King Richard, reserved by the Divine Hand for greater
things, returned to the camp, to the great joy of his
soldiers, who thanked God for his preservation, but
grieved for William de Pratelles, who loyally redeemed
the King at the price of his own liberty."
</p>

<p>
Richard was much blamed by some of his friends for his
rashness on this occasion.  "But," says Geoffrey the
hero-worshipper, "notwithstanding these admonitions
on the part of his best friends, the King's nature still
broke out; in all expeditions he was the first to advance
and the last to retreat; and he never failed, either by
his own valour or the Divine Aid, to bring back numbers
of captives, or, if they resisted, to put them to the
sword."
</p>

<p>
When the fortress of Joppa had been rebuilt, Richard
sent a "distinguished embassy" to Saladin and Saphadim,
his brother, to demand the surrender of the Holy Land
once more.  This was to include the whole kingdom of
Syria, as well as tribute for Babylon, and to this Saladin
would not agree.  At the same time he appeared to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
deal very reasonably with the embassy, sending back
with them his brother Saphadim, and offering through
him to give up the kingdom of Jerusalem "from the
Jordan to the sea," on condition that the city Ascalon
should never be rebuilt.  The account of the meeting of
the two great representatives of Christendom and Islam is
very interesting, and the more so because Richard never
came face to face with the renowned Saladin himself.
</p>

<p>
"When Saphadim came with this message to the King,
Richard, who had just been bled, would not converse with
him on that day; but he was supplied with every kind
of delicacy for his table, and entertained in the valley
between the castles of the Temple and Jehoshaphat.
</p>

<p>
"The next day Saphadim sent a present of seven
camels and a rich tent, and coming into the King's
presence, delivered Saladin's message, upon which
Richard determined to have patience for a time, that he
might the better make provision for the future.  But,
alas! he showed too little prudence in not foreseeing the
deceit with which they sought to protract the time until
the cities, castles and fortresses of that country were
destroyed.
</p>

<p>
"In short, Saphadim so cunningly beguiled the too
credulous king, that one would have thought they had
contracted a mutual friendship; for the King received
Saphadim's gifts, and messengers were daily passing
with presents to the King, much to the annoyance of his
friends.  But Saphadim pleaded that he wished to
make peace between them, and the King thought he
was adopting a wise policy, by which the bounds of
Christianity would be enlarged, and a creditable peace
concluded.
</p>

<p>
"When, however, the King discovered that the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
promises of Saphadim were mere words, he at once broke
off the negotiations."
</p>

<p>
The Saracens said in after days that Richard's friendship
with Saphadim went so far that he offered him his
sister Joanna in marriage; but that Joanna herself
refused with scorn to marry an infidel.
</p>

<p>
It was not until nearly the end of that year, when
much time had been lost, that the army of Richard
once more turned its face towards Jerusalem.  The
Templars however, tried to prevent the King from
attempting the siege of the Holy City, "lest, while they
were besieging Saladin and the garrison, the Turkish
army which was outside among the mountains, might
attack our men by surprise, and so place them between
the attack of the garrison from within and the Turkish
army from without."
</p>

<p>
But Richard was sick and tired of inaction, and his
army had been lately much depressed by the miserable
weather of winter.
</p>

<p>
The rain and the hail had killed many of their beasts of
burden; storms had torn up the pegs of the tents,
drowned the horses and spoiled all their biscuits and
bacon.  "Their clothes were dissolved by the wet, and
the men themselves suffered from the unwonted severity
of the climate."
</p>

<p>
"Under all those sufferings, their only consolation
arose from their zeal in the service of God, and a desire
to finish their pilgrimage.  Even those who were sick in
bed at Joppa were carried in litters, so great was their
wish to see Jerusalem."
</p>

<p>
But the weather grew worse, and at length the advice
of the Templars, experienced as they were in that
climate, prevailed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
</p>

<p>
Most of the French went back to Joppa, and with
much wrath on the part of Richard and deep despondency
on the part of his army, a march was made instead upon
the ruined town of Ascalon.
</p>

<p>
At the end of January, however, "the sky became
brighter," and many of the French were induced to
return to Richard, and to help him to rebuild the walls.
But very soon the old quarrels broke out.
</p>

<p>
The Duke of Burgundy, finding himself without the
means to pay his men, asked King Richard to supply
him with a large sum of money, as he had done once
before at Acre.  When the King refused, on the ground
that his previous loan had never been repaid, the duke
at once left Ascalon, taking his army with him, and went
back to Acre.
</p>

<p>
About the same time Conrad of Tyre gave mortal
offence to Richard by his refusal to come to help him to
rebuild the city, and the King, in his wrath, began to
make fresh attempts at peace with Saladin, on the plea
that his foeman was of nobler mettle than his so-called
allies.  Friendly overtures went so far that "on Palm
Sunday, King Richard, amid much splendour, girded
with the belt of knighthood the son of Saphadim, who
had been sent to him for that purpose."
</p>

<p>
After Easter, came bad news from England to the
King&mdash;news of the treachery of his brother John, of the
seizing of the revenues, and of an empty treasury.
</p>

<p>
"And if," said the prior of Hereford who brought this
news, "your majesty does not take speedy counsel on
these matters, and return home with all haste and avenge
our wrongs on the insurgents, it will fare worse, and you
will not be able to recover your kingdom without the
hazard of a war."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
</p>

<p>
When these things were laid before the leaders of the
army, as a reason why Richard must speedily return to
his own land, they unanimously declared that something
must be done to settle affairs in Palestine by choosing
a king, "one whom the army could follow and obey,"
and that if this were not done "they would one and all
depart from the land, for they should not otherwise be
able to guard against the enemy."  The choice was given
them between Guy of Lusignan and Conrad of Tyre, and
to the secret disgust of Richard, they chose the latter,
"as being much better able to defend the country."
</p>

<p>
The King gave his consent, though with no good will,
for the Marquis Conrad was known to be in league with
Saladin, who, on his part, was inclined to treat with him
against the advice of Saphadim, who would do nothing
"without King Richard's consent."
</p>

<p>
Conrad himself was delighted at the news that the
crown was his if he would but do his best against the foe,
and his followers at Tyre indulged, says Geoffrey, in a joy
"the more unreasonable for being so intemperate."
</p>

<p>
Then came a tragedy, swift and sudden.  The marquis
was returning one day in a very cheerful and pleasant
humour, from an entertainment given by the Bishop of
Beauvais, at which he had been a guest, and had reached
the Custom House of the city, when two young men,
without cloaks, suddenly rushed upon him, and having
drawn their daggers, stabbed him to the heart and ran
off at full speed.
</p>

<p>
"The marquis instantly fell from his horse and rolled
dying on the ground; one of the murderers was slain
directly, but the second took shelter in a church,
notwithstanding which he was captured and condemned to
be dragged through the city until life should be extinct.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Now while the marquis was breathing his last, the
attendants who were about him, took him up in their
arms, and carried him to the palace, mourning and
weeping inconsolably, the more so as their joy had been,
but now, so great.  He enjoined his wife to attend
carefully to the preservation of the city of Tyre, and to
resign it to no one, save King Richard.  Immediately
afterwards he died, and was buried in the Hospital
amidst great mourning and lamentation.
</p>

<p>
Thus the cheering hopes of that desolate land were
destroyed, and the former gladness was turned into
intense grief.
</p>

<p>
With great treachery the French now began to spread
abroad a report that Richard himself "had vilely
brought about the death of the marquis," an accusation
for which there was no shadow of proof.  Not content
with this, the French army, which lived in tents outside
the city sent orders to Queen Isabella, the wife of Conrad,
"bidding her place the city in their charge, without delay
or opposition, for the service of the King of France.
But she, mindful of the dying words of her lord, replied
that when King Richard came to see her, she would give
it up to him and to none other, as there was no one who
had laboured so much to rescue the Holy Land from the
hands of the Turks."
</p>

<p>
The French were very indignant at this reply, and
while they were attempting to gain possession of the
city, Count Henry of Champagne, the nephew of Richard,
arrived unexpectedly on the scene.
</p>

<p>
"And when the people saw him among them, they
forthwith chose him as their prince, as if he had been
sent by God; and began with much earnestness to
entreat him to accept the crown of the kingdom, without
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
excuse or hesitation, and to marry the widow of the
marquis, as the kingdom was hers by right of
inheritance."  To this Richard willingly agreed, and thus
Henry became the nominal king of Jerusalem, while the
Holy City remained in the hands of Islam.
</p>

<p>
The sympathy of our chronicler Geoffrey is, however,
entirely with the deposed Guy of Lusignan, "who," says
he "now dwelt within the kingdom like a private man,
not because he was undeserving, but for this only
reason&mdash;that he was simple-minded and unversed in political
intrigue.  Thus then Guy became a king without a kingdom,
until King Richard, moved with pity for him, gave him
the unconditional sovereignty of the island of Cyprus."
</p>

<p>
Further news of the disturbed state of his own kingdom
at home now arrived for Richard, but, in spite of this,
he was persuaded without much difficulty to defer his
return until the Easter of the following year, by which
time it was hoped that Jerusalem would have been taken.
</p>

<p>
This intelligence was proclaimed throughout the army
by means of a herald, "and when the army heard it,
they were as delighted as a bird at dawn of day, and all
immediately set themselves in readiness, packing up their
luggage and preparing for the march."
</p>

<p>
After a few days journey, a halt was called until
Count Henry could join them with the rest of the army
from Acre, and this delay enabled Richard to seize a
richly loaded caravan, an event which caused something
like a panic among the Turks.  "Never," says one of
them, "did any news so trouble the Sultan."
</p>

<p>
But the English King was only too well aware of the
real weakness of his army, and when the soldiers urged him
to march directly upon the Holy City, he firmly refused.
</p>

<p>
"If it pleases you to proceed to Jerusalem," he said
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
to the other leaders, "I will not desert you; I will be
your comrade but not your commander; I will follow,
not lead you.  Does not Saladin know all that goes on
in our camp?  And do you think that our weak
condition has escaped his notice?"
</p>

<p>
This was the occasion of great discontent among the
Crusaders.  In vain did the King propose to attack the
power of Islam in Cairo or Damascus; the French
declared that they would march only against Jerusalem,
from which they were now but four miles distant.
Quarrels arose among the soldiers, some taking one side,
some the other, and finally the army retreated, in separate
divisions and in a very depressed state, to Joppa, and
thence to Acre.
</p>

<p>
We may well believe that the heaviest heart in all that
company was that of the King himself.  They tell us
that in his pursuit of a party of Turks near Emmaus,
Richard found himself upon a hill from which he could
catch a glimpse of the Holy City in the distance.  Turning
away his eyes, he cried out with tears that he was not
worthy even to look upon the spot which he had failed
to wrest from the hand of the infidel; and so he retraced
his steps in sadness to the sea-shore.
</p>

<p>
The retreat of the army from Joppa was an opportunity
not to be lost by the astute Saladin.  Whilst Richard was
vainly trying to patch up a truce with him from Acre,
the Sultan swooped down on the unprotected walls of
Joppa and took the city after a five days' siege.
</p>

<p>
This news of the arrival of Saladin reached Acre just as
Richard was preparing to sail to his own land.  He
immediately set off with fifty knights in two or three
galleys and being detained by contrary winds, reached
the city only to find the banners of Saladin floating from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
the walls, and all the city save one tower in his hands.
Dashing through the waves to the shore, Richard led his
little band to the gates of the city, forced his way in, tore
down the flag of Islam and hoisted his own in its stead.
</p>

<p>
"Saladin, hearing of the King's arrival, and of his
brilliant contest with the Turks, of whom he had slain
all who opposed him, was seized with sudden fear, and
like that timid animal the hare, put spurs to his horse,
and fled before his face."
</p>

<p>
Presently, however, it dawned upon him that instead
of having been attacked by a great army from Acre,
he had been routed by a mere handful of men, most of
whom were now sleeping unprotected in camp.
</p>

<p>
"But a certain Genoese was led by the divine impulse
to go out early in the morning into the fields, where he
was alarmed by the noise of men and horses advancing,
and returned speedily, but just had time to see helmets
reflecting back the light which now fell upon them.  He
immediately rushed with speed into the camp, calling
out "To arms!  To arms!"
</p>

<p>
The King was awakened by the noise, and leaping
startled from his bed, put on his coat of mail and
summoned his men to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
During the battle that followed, in which Richard is
said to have performed almost incredible deeds of
valour, Saphadim showed him an example of generosity
and courtesy.
</p>

<p>
The King had been unhorsed and was fighting
desperately on foot when "a Turk advanced towards him
mounted on a prancing steed.  He had been sent by
Saphadim, who now sent to the King as a token of his
well known honourable character, two noble horses,
requesting him earnestly to accept them and make use of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
them, and if he returned safe and sound out of that
battle, to remember the gifts and to recompense it in any
way he pleased."
</p>

<p>
This was the last battle fought and the last victory
won by Richard in the Holy Land.  He himself fell
ill from the fatigue of that day, the French refused to
fight any more under his leadership, and England and
Normandy were clamouring for his return.
</p>

<p>
So he employed Saphadim, always kindly disposed
towards him, to intercede with Saladin for a truce; and
this was finally agreed upon for the space of three years,
the Christians meantime holding Joppa and Tyre, and
all the land between; and all pilgrims having the right
to visit Jerusalem in safety.
</p>

<p>
But the Holy City remained yet in the hands of the
infidel, and the Third Crusade had come to an end before
its real work had been begun.
</p>

<p>
Well might Richard gaze upon the land with heavy
heart as he set sail for Europe.
</p>

<p>
"All night the ship ran on her way by the light of the
stars, and when morning dawned, the King looked back
with yearning eyes upon the land he had left; and after
long meditation he prayed aloud in these words.
</p>

<p>
"O Holy Land, I commend thee to God, and if His
heavenly grace shall grant me so long to live, that I may,
in His good pleasure, afford thee assistance, I hope, as I
propose, to be able to be some day a succour to thee."
</p>

<p>
But though he had not yet come to the end of his
adventures in connection with it, the deeds of Richard,
in the Holy Land he loved, were over.
</p>

<p>
He had sent on his wife and sister in front, and they
had reached Sicily in safety, whilst he himself set out in a
single vessel, only to meet with such stormy winds, that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
he found himself at length a shipwrecked stranger on that
strip of the Istrian coast that borders the Adriatic Sea.
</p>

<p>
It was an unlucky spot for Richard.  The governor of
the district was Maynard, a nephew of that Conrad of
Tyre of whose death the English King was held to be
guilty.
</p>

<p>
Nor was Vienna very far off&mdash;Vienna ruled by Leopold
of Austria, his ancient foe.  But Richard's beard had
been allowed to grow of late, and pilgrims' dresses were
not difficult to obtain for himself and his companion,
Baldwin of Bethune.
</p>

<p>
Making his way to the Castle of Maynard, with his
usual rashness he bade Baldwin win his way to the
governor by the gift of a magnificent ruby ring taken
from his own finger, and ask of him a passport for the
two, Baldwin and "Hugh the Merchant," as for pilgrims
making their way back through the province from
Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
Long did Maynard gaze upon the jewel, until at length
he said "This jewel can come only from a king; and
that king can only be Richard of England.  Bid him
come to me in peace."
</p>

<p>
But Richard would not enter the lion's cage.  He
fled in the night to Friesach, leaving Baldwin and his
other companions to be seized as hostages and kept in
bonds.  Travelling about the country with one knight
as his comrade, together with a boy who could speak
the language, Richard drew nearer and nearer to the
dangerous region of Vienna.
</p>

<p>
Resting in the inn of a town close by the capital, he
sent the boy to buy food for their journey in the
marketplace.  The lad chose to swagger and boast of his
master's wealth and mysterious high position, in proof
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
of which he pulled out a handful of gold coins before the
bystanders.
</p>

<p>
This was the cause of his immediate discomfiture, for
he was seized, carried before the chief man of the district
and questioned as to whom he served.
</p>

<p>
He refused to disclose the name of his master, and was
put to the torture.  This was no light matter in those
rough days, and under it the boy confessed that he was
the page of Richard of England.
</p>

<p>
The news was carried hotfoot to Leopold, and meantime
a troop of armed men surrounded the inn where lay the
unsuspecting monarch.
</p>

<p>
Richard, however, was never to be caught with ease.
Sword in hand he defended himself with such vigour that
the men fell back.  Escape was hopeless, notwithstanding
this pause, and the King at length agreed to yield
if their chief would come in person to take him.
</p>

<p>
But this chief turned out to be Leopold of Austria
himself, grimly delighted to find his former foe within
his clutches.  Other forces were also at work to get
possession of the person of the English King.  Philip of
France had not forgotten his ancient grudge against him;
and it was to his advantage that Richard's return to
England should be hindered, since he intended
meantime to annex Normandy.  John, the King's brother,
would now have his chance of obtaining the coveted
English crown, and so it was to the interest of all his
enemies to keep him safe within prison walls.  But a
yet more powerful enemy was in league with both, and
only too ready to take revenge upon Richard for the
part he had once played in taking the side of Tancred
of Sicily against him.  The Emperor Henry VI. son of
Barbarossa, offered Leopold a bribe of £60,000 for the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
person of the King, and Richard found himself closely
confined in a lonely castle of the Tyrol, the prisoner of the
Emperor.
</p>

<p>
For a while no one knew of his place of concealment,
nor into whose hands he had fallen.
</p>

<p>
At length, says the romantic story, this was discovered
by his faithful minstrel, Blondel, who travelled over
Eastern Europe, searching and inquiring for his master.
One day, as he sat beneath the walls of a castle keep, he
began to play upon his lute one of the troubadour airs
that Richard had loved to sing in former days.  To his
surprise, the song was softly echoed from the walls.
Staying only long enough to make sure that it was his beloved
master, the minstrel sped back with the news to England.
</p>

<p>
This charming story may have no foundation save in
the fact that the English Chancellor, William Longchamp,
in his wish to leave no stone unturned in the attempt to
discover the King, sent out messengers of all ranks and
degrees on his behalf.  Whoever found out his place of
imprisonment matters little; for, directly it was known,
all the powers of Christendom were set on foot to work
the release of one who had done so much for the cause of
God in the Holy Land.
</p>

<p>
The Pope brought pressure to bear upon the Emperor;
the Emperor consented to accept a ransom for his royal
captive, in spite of the fact that John of England had
offered him twenty thousand pounds for every month
that Richard could be kept in prison; and the
hard-pressed English people once more brought out their
coins on behalf of a King whose eastern expeditions had
already cost them dear.
</p>

<p>
And thus at length the adventures of the Lion Heart
in connection with the Third Crusade came to an end.

CHAPTER XIII
<br />
  The Story of Dandolo the Blind Doge;<br />
  or, The Fourth and Fifth Crusades<br />
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  <i>Oh for one hour of blind old Dandolo!<br />
  Th'octogenarian chief, Byzantium's conquering foe.</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BYRON: <i>Childe Harold.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Richard the Lion-Heart had returned to
England in 1194.  The next three years of the
dying century saw an attempt at an expedition
sometimes known as the Fourth, more often as the
"German" Crusade.
</p>

<p>
Its story contains little of interest.  Saladin had died
before the release of Richard, and his brother Saphadim
reigned in his stead, when Henry, Emperor of Germany,
hoping to win the favour of his disapproving subjects,
sent an expedition to the Holy Land.
</p>

<p>
The Christian lords who yet held rule in Palestine had
found things run so smoothly under the hand of the
Sultan during the long truce, that they were in no hurry
to break the peace.  But the Germans did not mean
to wait for their assistance, and while they were
marshalling their forces, Saphadim drew first blood by a sudden
and successful attack upon Joppa, once so ably held and
fortified by Richard.
</p>

<p>
The German Crusaders retaliated by a victory or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
rather a series of victories, which restored to them Joppa
and many other coast towns, and augured well for the
future.  All this, however, was undone by their own
cruelty and thirst for blood.
</p>

<p>
On their triumphant march to Jerusalem they were
besieging a certain castle, and had succeeded in
tunnelling passages through the rock upon which it
stood.  Hopeless of escape, the Moslem garrison offered
to surrender on condition that they were allowed a safe
passage into their own territory.  To this the Crusaders
agreed, but a certain number of them were loud in their
disapproval, and began to threaten the Saracens to such
an extent that the latter lost faith in the promises that
had been given.  Declaring that they would die rather
than submit, they lined the newly-cut rock-passages and
prepared to sell their lives dearly.
</p>

<p>
The Crusaders, furious at their defiant message, dashed
into the dark tunnels, only to fall by thousands at the
hands of their unseen and desperate foes.  Nightfall
saw them repulsed and utterly dismayed at the
unexpected resistance; discipline was gone, none knew
what to do next.  Then followed a disgraceful breach of
honour.  Their leaders stole away under cover of the
darkness, and the German soldiers found themselves
left at the mercy of the foe.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for them, the Saracens were too exhausted
to pursue their advantage, and the Germans, leaving
their baggage and even their weapons behind them, fled
in disorder to Tyre.
</p>

<p>
The news of the death of their Emperor recalled
most of these faint-hearted Soldiers of the Cross to
Germany.
</p>

<p>
The remainder made one last endeavour to fortify
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
Joppa and entrench themselves within it; but, in the
November of 1197, the city fell before a furious attack
of the Saracens, and the greater part of the inhabitants
were slaughtered.
</p>

<p>
This was the sad and disgraceful end of the Fourth
Crusade, which left the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem
a kingdom only in name.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Fifth Crusade is remarkable for the fact that it
began in an outburst of keen religious enthusiasm, and
ended in a riot of cruelty, bloodshed and profanity,
without ever reaching the Holy Land at all.
</p>

<p>
Two very different men were responsible for stirring
up this Crusade in Europe.  Innocent the Third, one
of the youngest, most energetic and most ambitious of
popes, thought to find in it an opportunity of increasing
his "temporal" as well as spiritual power.  It had long
been the custom for princes, going forth on perilous
adventure, to leave their lands in charge of the Holy
Father; and even if this were not always done, the
Crusades gave many a chance of interfering with the
affairs of kingdoms and dukedoms whose people were
engaged in the great religious war.
</p>

<p>
Apart from this, the young Pope was, like all enthusiasts
in religion, deeply affected by the idea of the unhappy
state of the Holy Land, and sincerely desired to stir the
hearts of the princes of Europe to do their part towards
restoring it to Christendom.  But the princes of Europe
had had enough of Crusades and they turned a deaf ear
to the call.  It needed another Peter the Hermit, or at
least another St Bernard to stir the hearts of rich and
poor to march forth once more upon a quest that had cost
them already so dear.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
</p>

<p>
Then the right man appeared upon the scene.  A
certain French priest, Fulk by name, in atonement for a
life of carelessness and sin, began to preach the duty of
taking up the Cross in the Holy War.  A mere village
<i>curé</i>, he was content at first to teach and speak only in
his own neighbourhood, but his reputation increased, he
became noted as a worker of miracles, and rumours about
him ere long reached the ears of the Pope.  Innocent
III. quickly saw in him the instrument he needed.  Throughout
the streets and slums of Paris, in castle and in cottage,
Fulk was encouraged to make his way, calling upon men
to repent of their sins and to atone for them by taking
up arms for the Cause of Christ.
</p>

<p>
As usual, "the common people heard him gladly,"
while for a time the nobles ignored him.
</p>

<p>
Then it came to pass that young Count Theobald
of Champagne held a great tournament, at which
assembled two thousand knights.  Into the midst of that
gay throng appeared on a sudden the inspired face of
Fulk the priest, dressed in his threadbare cassock.  His
burning words carried conviction to the hearts of the
knights, and Theobald himself was the first to take up
the Cross.  Others followed&mdash;amongst them Simon de
Montfort, father of the famous "good Earl Simon" of
English history&mdash;and finally nearly all that great band
of knights were enlisted as Crusaders.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere the same result was seen.  Great sums
of money were raised for the enterprise.  Louis, Count
of Blois, and Baldwin, Count of Flanders, joined the
band of leaders, and while preparations went on apace
in France, Baldwin mindful of the chief reason for past
failures, sent a message to Dandolo, the blind Doge of
Venice, asking him to supply flat-bottomed boats in which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
for a certain sum of money, the Crusading armies might
be transported to the Holy Land.
</p>

<p>
One of those sent upon this mission was Geoffrey de
Villehardouin, Marshal of Champagne, who tells the story
of this, the Fifth Crusade, so vividly.[<a id="chap13fn1text"></a><a href="#chap13fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap13fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap13fn1text">1</a>] The following extracts from Villehardouin
and Joinville are quoted,
by kind permission of Messrs Dent &amp; Co.,
from the admirable translation
of Sir Frank Marzials in the <i>Everyman's Library</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The Doge of Venice," says he, "whose name was
Henry Dandolo, and who was very wise and very
valiant, did them (the envoys) great honour, and
entertained them right willingly, marvelling, however, what
might be the matter that had brought them to that
country.  The envoys entered the palace, which was
passing rich and beautiful, and found the Doge and his
council in a chamber.
</p>

<p>
"There they delivered their message after this
manner.  'Sire, we come to thee on the part of the high
barons of France who have taken the Sign of the Cross to
avenge the shame done to Jesus Christ and to reconquer
Jerusalem, if so be that God will suffer it.  And because
they know that no people have such great power to help
them as you and your people, therefore we pray you by
God that you take pity on the land oversea, and the
shame of Christ, and use diligence that our lords have
ships for transport and battle.'
</p>

<p>
"'And after what manner should we use diligence?'
said the Doge.
</p>

<p>
"'After all manner that you may advise and propose,'
rejoined the envoys, 'in so far as what you propose may
be within our means.'
</p>

<p>
"'Certes,' said the Doge, 'it is a great thing that your
lords require of us, and well it seems that they have in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
view a high enterprise.  We will give you our answer
eight days from to-day, for it is meet so great a matter
be fully pondered.'"
</p>

<p>
So eight days later, when the covenant had been
proposed and accepted by the council and the envoys, a
"mass of the Holy Ghost was celebrated in the chapel
of St Mark, 'the most beautiful chapel that there is.'  To
this gathered 'well ten thousand of the people,'
and immediately afterwards the French envoys were
bidden 'to humbly ask them to assent to the proposed
covenant.'
</p>

<p>
"Villehardouin himself was spokesman before that
multitude, and said unto them.  'Lords, the barons of
France, most high and puissant, have sent us to you, and
they cry to you for mercy, that you have pity on
Jerusalem, which is in bondage to the Turks, and that for
God's sake, you help to avenge the shame of Christ Jesus.
</p>

<p>
"And for this end they have elected to come to you,
because they know full well that there is none other
people having so great power on the seas as you and
your people.  And they commanded us to fall at your
feet, and not to rise till you consent to take pity on the
Holy Land which is beyond the seas.'
</p>

<p>
"Then the six envoys knelt at the feet of the people,
weeping many tears.  And the Doge and all the others
burst into tears of pity and compassion, and cried with
one voice, and lifted up their hands, saying: 'We
consent!  We consent!'
</p>

<p>
"Then was there so great a noise and tumult that it
seemed as if the earth itself were falling to pieces.
</p>

<p>
"And when this great tumult and passion of pity&mdash;greater
did never any man see&mdash;were appeased, the
Good Doge of Venice, who was very wise and valiant,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
went up into the reading-desk, and spoke to the people,
and said to them:
</p>

<p>
"'Signors, behold the honour that God has done you,
for the best people in the world have set aside all other
people, and chosen you to join them in so high an
enterprise as the deliverance of our Lord.'"
</p>

<p>
Thus comes on the stage upon which was played the
story of the Fifth Crusade, that curious and interesting
figure, the blind old Doge, Henry Dandolo, who, for all
intents and purposes, may be regarded as the leader of
that expedition, so completely did he sway its designs
by his counsel and action.
</p>

<p>
Years before, or so the story goes, he had been sent
on an embassy to Constantinople, and there had been
seized and treacherously ill-used so that he became
practically blind.  Whether this is true or not, the fact
remains that Dandolo hated the Greeks with a bitter
hatred, and was ready to use any means towards their
hurt or downfall.
</p>

<p>
So the treaty was made, and the Crusaders promised
to pay the whole expenses of the expedition, a sum
amounting to eighty-five thousand pieces of silver, on
condition that they were provided food and transport.
And to show their goodwill, the Venetians added fifty
armed galleys to the fleet, "for the love of God."
</p>

<p>
Then the envoys returned rejoicing, only to meet with
one piece of ill luck after another.
</p>

<p>
On his journey to Champagne, Geoffrey de Villehardouin
met a large company of men, amongst whom were several
important barons who had taken the Cross, and who were
now following Walter of Brienne on an expedition to
conquer the land of his wife, the daughter of King Tancred
of Sicily.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Now when he told them the news how the envoys
had fared, great was their joy, and much did they prize
the arrangements made.  And they said, 'We are
already on our way; and when you come, you will find
us ready.'"
</p>

<p>
"But," comments Geoffrey somewhat wearily, for this
was but the first of many wasteful and irregular
expeditions, "events fall out as God wills, and never had
they power to join the host.  This was much to our loss,
for they were of great prowess and valiant."  And then
they parted and each went on his way.
</p>

<p>
The next blow hit Geoffrey very hard.  He rode day
by day so that he came at length, he says, to Troyes, in
Champagne, and found his lord, Count Theobald, sick
and languishing, and right glad was the Count at his
coming.  And when he had told him how he fared,
Theobald was so rejoiced that he said he would mount
his horse, a thing he had not done for a long time.  So
he rose from his bed and rode forth.  "But alas: how
great the pity!  For never again did he bestride horse
but that once."
</p>

<p>
Growing worse and worse, the Count began to realise
that his part in the Crusade was over.  So he divided
the money which would have taken him on pilgrimage
among his followers and companions, giving orders that
each one, on receiving it, should swear "on holy relics,
to join the host at Venice."
</p>

<p>
"Many there were," says Geoffrey, "who kept that
oath badly and so incurred great blame."
</p>

<p>
So the Count Theobald died and was buried, and the
Crusaders looked about them for another chief.  First
they went to Odo, Duke of Burgundy, his cousin, and
offered him their faith and loyalty.  "But such was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
his pleasure that he refused.  And be it known to you
that he might have done much better," is the terse
comment of Geoffrey.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Boniface, Marquis of Montferrat, one of the
foremost nobles in that land, a patron of poets and
troubadours and a skilled soldier, received the "lordship
of the host."
</p>

<p>
"Whereupon the Bishop of Soissons, and Master Fulk,
that holy man, and two white monks whom the Marquis
had brought with him from his own land, led him into
the church of Notre Dame at Soissons, and attached the
Cross to his shoulder."
</p>

<p>
The death of Theobald was not the last blow that fate
had in store for the Crusaders, says Geoffrey.  "Thus
did the pilgrims make ready in all lands.  Alas!  A
great mischance befell them in the following Lent, before
they had started, for another notable chief, Count
Geoffrey of Perche, fell sick, and made his will in such
fashion that he directed that Stephen, his brother,
should have his goods and lead his men in the host.  Of
this exchange the pilgrims would willingly have been
quit, had God so ordered.  Thus did the Count make
an end and die; and much evil ensued, for he was a
baron high and honoured, and a good knight.  Greatly
was he mourned throughout all lands."
</p>

<p>
It was soon after the Easter of 1202 that the French
Crusaders began their march.  Fulk himself, the
originator of the movement, did not accompany them,
remaining behind, possibly to stir up fresh enthusiasm
and supplies of money if not of men.  But he was not
destined to see with his bodily eyes the failure of the
expedition, for he died of fever at Neuilly, while the
pilgrims were still at Venice.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
</p>

<p>
The French army marched by way of the Jura
Mountains and through Lombardy, where they were
joined by the Marquis of Montferrat with his troops of
Lombards, Piedmontese and Savoyards, and by a small
band of Germans.
</p>

<p>
At the same time a fleet had started from Flanders,
the leaders of which had promised Count Baldwin to join
the Crusaders at Venice.
</p>

<p>
"But ill did these keep the faith they had sworn to the
Count, they and others like them, because they, and such
others of the same sort, became fearful of the great perils
that the host of Venice had undertaken."
</p>

<p>
Many of the French leaders, too, failed the main body
of the Crusaders in the same way; for they avoided the
passage to Venice because of the danger, and went instead
to Marseilles, "whereof," says Geoffrey, "they received
shame and much were they blamed&mdash;and great were the
mishaps that afterwards befell them."
</p>

<p>
Meantime, the French army, under the Marquis of
Montferrat, had arrived safely at Venice, and was
rejoiced to see the fair array of ships and transports
waiting to convey it to the Holy Land.
</p>

<p>
But now an unexpected difficulty arose; for, of all
that great number of barons who had sworn to bring
their men to Venice, only a very few had arrived; and
then came the disconcerting news that many of these
pilgrims were travelling by other ways and from other
ports.
</p>

<p>
Consternation ensued among the barons, for the
Venetians were naturally determined that the money
stipulated for the transports should be paid at once, and
this could only be done if all the barons bore their share,
as they had agreed to do.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
</p>

<p>
So envoys, amongst whom was again found Geoffrey
de Villehardouin, were sent to intercept the various
leaders of armies, and "to beseech them to have pity
on the Holy Land beyond the sea, and show them that no
other passages save that from Venice could be of profit."
</p>

<p>
These envoys met with only partial success.  Count
Louis of Blois agreed to accompany them, but many
others chose to go their own way.  "And then," says
Geoffrey, "was the host of those who went by Venice
greatly weakened, and much evil befell them therefrom,
as you shall shortly hear."
</p>

<p>
The Venetians had done their part well.  They
"held a market" for the Crusaders, "rich and abundant,
of all things needful for horses and men.  And the fleet
they had got ready was so goodly and fine that never did
Christian man see one goodlier or finer; both galleys and
transports; and sufficient for at least three times as
many men as were in the host."
</p>

<p>
The first difficulty arose, naturally, over the matter of
payment.  Each man had done what he could, but the
total sum came to less than half of that which was due.
</p>

<p>
Earnestly did the barons urge the need of making
further payment in fulfilment of their promise.  "For
God's sake," said they, "let each contribute all that he
has, so that we may fulfil our covenant; for better it is
that we should lose all that we have than lose what we
have already paid and prove false to our promises; for
if this host remains here, the rescue of the land oversea
comes to naught."
</p>

<p>
But the other barons and the lesser folk said, "We
have paid for our passages, and if they will take us, we
shall go willingly, but if not, we shall inquire and look
for other means of passage."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
</p>

<p>
"They spoke thus," says Geoffrey, "because they
wished that the host should fall to pieces and each return
to his own land."
</p>

<p>
But the finer spirits preferred to face ruin, as far as
worldly prospects went, and to go penniless with the
host, rather than that the expedition should fail.  "For
God," said they, "will doubtless repay us when it so
pleases Him."
</p>

<p>
So they began to give and to borrow all that they could.
"Then might you have seen many a fine vessel of silver
and gold borne in payment to the palace of the Doge."  But
still a large part of the sum required was lacking.
</p>

<p>
Then the Doge, seeing their plight, made a proposal
to them.  To his own citizens he said, "Signors, these
people cannot pay more, and in so far as they have paid
at all, we have benefited by an agreement that they
cannot now fulfil.  But our right to keep this money
would not everywhere be acknowledged, and if we so
kept it, we should be greatly blamed, both us and our
land.  Let us therefore offer them terms.
</p>

<p>
"'The King of Hungary has taken from us Zara, in
Sclavonia, which is one of the strongest places in the
world; and never shall we recover it with all the power
that we possess, save with the help of these people.  Let
us therefore ask them to help us to reconquer it, and we
will remit the payment of the rest of the debt, until
such time as it shall please God to allow us to gain the
moneys by conquest, we and they together.'
</p>

<p>
"And to this the Venetians and the Crusading host
agreed."  A striking and pathetic scene followed.

</p>

<p>
On a very high festival the church of St Mark was
thronged with citizens, barons and pilgrims.  Before
High Mass began, the blind and aged Doge, Henry
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
Dandolo, was led up to the reading-desk, from whence
he spoke thus to his people.
</p>

<p>
"'Signors, you are associated with the most worthy
people in the world, and for the highest enterprise ever
undertaken; and I am a man, old and feeble, who
should have need of rest, and I am sick in body; but I
see that no one could command and lead you like myself,
who am your lord.
</p>

<p>
"If you will consent that I take the Sign of the Cross
to guard and direct you, and that my son remain in my
place to guard the land, then shall I go to live or die with
you and with the pilgrims.'
</p>

<p>
"And when they heard him, they cried with one voice,
'We pray you by God that you consent and do it, and
that you come with us!'"
</p>

<p>
"He was of a great heart," says Geoffrey, comparing
him bitterly with those who had gone to other ports to
escape danger.
</p>

<p>
"Then he came down from the reading-desk, and went
before the altar, and knelt upon his knees, greatly
weeping.  And they sewed the cross on to a great cotton hat
which he wore, and in front because he wished that all
men should see it."
</p>

<p>
His example sent many of the Venetians to follow in
his steps, and at the same time preparations were
hurried on for the departure, for September was now nigh
at hand.
</p>

<p>
Just before they started, messengers appeared in their
midst with an appeal that was destined to change the
whole aim of the Fifth Crusade.
</p>

<p>
"At that time," says Geoffrey in his terse way, "there
was an emperor in Constantinople whose name was Isaac,
and he had a brother, Alexios by name, whom he had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
ransomed from captivity among the Turks.  This
Alexios took his brother, the Emperor, tore the eyes out
of his head, and made himself emperor by the aforesaid
treachery.  He kept Isaac a long time in prison, together
with his son Alexios.  This son escaped from prison, and
fled in a ship to a city on the sea, which is called Ancona.
"Thence he departed to go to King Philip of Germany,
who had married his sister, and so came to Verona, in
Lombardy, and lodged in the town, and found there a
number of pilgrims and other people who were on their
way to join the host.
</p>

<p>
"And those who had helped him to escape, and were
with him, said, 'Sire, here is an army in Venice, quite
near to us, the best and most valiant people and knights
that are in the world, and they are going oversea.  Cry
to them therefore for mercy, that they have pity on
thee and on thy father, who have been so wrongfully
dispossessed.  And if they be willing to help thee, thou
shalt be guided by them.  Perchance they will take pity
on thy estate.'
</p>

<p>
"So the young Alexios said he would do this right
willingly, and that the advice was good."
</p>

<p>
Then he sent envoys to the Marquis of Montferrat,
chief of the host, and the barons agreed that if he would
help them to recover the land oversea, they would help
him to recover the land so wrongfully wrested from him
and his father.  They sent also an envoy with the prince
to King Philip of Germany; and in consequence, a
goodly number of German soldiers joined the host at
Venice and prepared to aid them in their enterprise.
</p>

<p>
And then, after long delay, the Crusading army set out
from the port of Venice in the month of October, 1202.

CHAPTER XIV
<br />
The Forsaking of the High Enterprise

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Siege of Zara affords one more example of
the fatal disunion which was always appearing
among the ranks of the Crusaders.
</p>

<p>
From the first, the Abbot de Vaux, who had to some
extent taken the place of the priest Fulk (now gone to
his rest), had protested against warring upon the King
of Hungary, who was himself a Crusader.  The Pope sent
urgent messages forbidding the whole enterprise; and
when he found that the Venetians paid no heed to this
prohibition, the Marquis of Montferrat, leader of the host,
found convenient business which would for some time
detain him from leading the host against his
fellow-Christians.
</p>

<p>
Even when the Crusaders assembled before the city
walls, there were plenty of traitors in the camp only too
ready to work mischief.  When the people of Zara,
utterly dismayed at the sight of the great host before
their walls, sent messengers to the Doge, offering to yield
up city and goods, if only their lives were spared, the
latter replied, quite rightly, that he must first get the
consent of the counts and barons of the Crusading
pilgrims before he could accept any conditions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
</p>

<p>
But while the Doge tried to obtain this consent, some
of the discontented and disloyal members were busy
talking to the envoys.  "Why should you surrender
your city?  The pilgrims will not attack you&mdash;have no
fear of them.  If you can defend yourselves against the
Venetians, you will be safe enough."  One of them even
went upon the walls of the city and made a similar
declaration to the citizens.
</p>

<p>
Consequently the envoys returned to those who sent
them, and the negotiations were broken off.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the Doge and the barons had promptly
decided to accept the conditions offered, and were
returning to make this known in public, when the Abbot
de Vaux confronted the council with&mdash;"Lords, I forbid
you on the part of the Pope of Rome to attack this city;
for those within it are Christians and you are pilgrims,"
and then informed the Doge that the envoys had
departed.
</p>

<p>
Great was the wrath of Dandolo, as he declared to the
counts and barons, "Signors, I had this city, by their own
agreement, at my mercy, and your people have broken
that agreement; you have covenanted to help me to
conquer it, and I summon you to do so."
</p>

<p>
"Now are we ashamed if we do not help to take the
city," was the verdict of the Crusaders when the matter
had been discussed, and they came to the Doge and said:
</p>

<p>
"Sire, we will help you to take the city in despite of
those who would let and hinder us."
</p>

<p>
It was a sorry business altogether, that siege of Zara,
and though we may sympathise with their reluctance
to attack their fellow-Christians with the arms destined
for the fall of Islam, we must remember the solemn
undertaking given to the Doge in payment of a just debt.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
Fortunately the siege lasted but five days, when the
citizens, finding their position hopeless, surrendered the
city on condition that their lives were spared.  With
great generosity the Doge divided the town into two
parts, and handed one over to the French for winter
quarters.  The Venetians settled on the other, for it was
impossible to return before Easter.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had they been lodged there three days when
"there began a fray, exceeding fell and fierce, between
the Venetians and the Franks ... and the fray was so
fierce that there were but few streets in which battle did
not rage with swords and lances and cross-bows and
darts; and many people were killed and wounded."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps this incident served to convince the leaders
of the difficulty of inducing the quarrelsome soldiers
of two nations to sit down together in peace for any
considerable period, and to induce them to look with
more favour upon their next visitors.  These were the
envoys of King Philip of Germany and the young
Alexios, who came, bringing this message to the Crusaders
and the Doge:
</p>

<p>
"Lords," said King Philip, "I will send you the
brother of my wife, and I commit him into the hands of
God&mdash;may He keep him from death&mdash;and into your
hands.  And because you have fared forth for God,
and for right, and for justice, therefore are you bound, in
so far as you are able, to restore to their own inheritance
those who have been unrighteously despoiled.  And my
wife's brother will make with you the best terms ever
offered to any people, and give you the most puissant
help for the recovery of the land oversea."
</p>

<p>
This proposal was the occasion of much debate.  The
Abbot de Vaux was all for the dispersal of the host, or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
an immediate advance upon Palestine.  The other side
pointed out that they would not be able to do anything,
disunited as they were, if they went to Palestine, and
that it was only "by way of Babylon or of Greece, that
the land oversea could actually be recovered."
</p>

<p>
"If we reject this covenant," they urged, "we shall be
shamed to all time."
</p>

<p>
So the treaty with Alexios was accepted, even by the
Marquis of Montferrat, who had at first held aloof in
deference to the wishes of the Pope.  Innocent himself
did all in his power to break down their resolve, hurling
the bolt of excommunication upon the Venetians, and
warning the Crusaders that the Empire of Constantinople
was under his special protection.  But Dandolo remained
unmoved, and the Crusading chiefs, influenced by the
desire for the rich booty of Constantinople, were all on
his side save Simon de Montfort, who betook himself,
with his men, and several of his colleagues, forthwith to
the Court of Hungary.  It was pointed out to the Pope
that the fall of Constantinople would bring back the
Eastern Church within the fold of the Western Church,
and the threats of Innocent grew fainter and fainter as
preparation for the attack went on apace, and the young
prince Alexios himself joined the host at Zara.
</p>

<p>
So, on the Eve of Pentecost, 1203, "there were all the
ships assembled, and all the transports, and all the
galleys of the host, and many other ships of merchants
that fared with them.  And the day was fine and clear,
and the wind soft and favourable, and they unfurled all
their sails to the breeze.
</p>

<p>
"And Geoffrey, the Marshal of Champagne, who
dictates this work, <i>and has never lied therein by one word
to his knowledge</i>, and who was, moreover, present at all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
the councils held&mdash;he bears witness that never was yet
seen so fair a sight.  Well might it appear that such a
fleet would conquer and gain lands, for, far as the eye
could reach, there was no space without sails, and
ships, and vessels, so that the hearts of men rejoiced
greatly."
</p>

<p>
At the Straits of Malea they met two ships full of the
pilgrims who had deserted them at Venice and taken
their own way; "Who, when they saw our fleet so rich
and well-appointed, conceived such shame that they
dared not show themselves."
</p>

<p>
From one of these a sergeant suddenly let himself
down into a boat, saying to those on deck, "I am quits
to you for any goods of mine that may remain in the ship,
for I am going with these people, for well I deem they will
conquer lands."
</p>

<p>
"Much did we make of the sergeant," comments
Geoffrey, quaintly, "and gladly was he received into the
host.  For well may it be said, that even after following
a thousand crooked ways a man may find his way right
in the end."
</p>

<p>
And so at length they came to the port of St Stephen,
from whence they had a good view of Constantinople.
"Upon which they looked very earnestly, for they never
thought there could be in the world so rich a city; and
they marked the high walls and strong towers that
enclosed it round about, and the rich palaces and mighty
churches&mdash;of which there were so many that no one would
have believed it who had not seen it with his eyes&mdash;and
the height and length of that city which above all others
was sovereign.
</p>

<p>
"And be it known to you that no man there was of such
hardihood, but his flesh trembled; and it was no wonder,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
for never was so great an enterprise undertaken by any
people since the Creation of the World!
</p>

<p>
"Next day they took port before the magnificent royal
palace that faced the city, just across the straits, and
finding plenty of corn, for it was harvest time, the
leaders took possession of the palace, and all were well
content."
</p>

<p>
It was not long before the usurping Emperor Alexios
realised his peril, and sent to them envoys bearing fair
messages.
</p>

<p>
"Lords," said they, "the Emperor Alexios would have
you know that he is well aware that you are the best
people uncrowned, and come from the best land on earth.
And he marvels much why, and for what purpose, you
have come into his land and kingdom.  For you are
Christians, and he is a Christian, and well he knows that
you are on your way to deliver the Holy Land oversea
and the Holy Cross and the Sepulchre.
</p>

<p>
"If you are poor and in want, he will right willingly
give you of his food and substance, provided you depart
out of his land.  Neither would he otherwise wish to
do you any hurt, though he has full power therein, seeing
that if you were twenty times as numerous as you are,
you would not be able to get away without utter
discomfiture if so be that he wished to harm you."
</p>

<p>
"Then arose that good knight, Conon of Bethune, and
said, 'Fair sirs, you have told us that your lord marvels
much why we should have entered into his kingdom and
land.  Into his land they have not entered, for he holds
this land wrongfully and wickedly, against God and
against reason.  It belongs to his nephew, who sits upon
a throne among us, and is the son of his brother, the
Emperor Isaac.  But, if he is willing to throw himself
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
upon the mercy of his nephew and to give him back his
crown and empire, then will we pray his nephew to
forgive him, and bestow upon him as much as will enable
him to live in wealth.  And if you come not as the bearer
of such a message, then be not so bold as to come here
again.'"
</p>

<p>
Next morning the Crusaders determined to show the
young Alexios to the people of the city; so the Doge of
Venice and the Marquis of Montferrat entered into one
galley, taking the prince with them, and the knights and
barons crowded into as many other boats as they could
get.  They came close to the city walls and showed the
youth to the Greeks, saying, "Behold your natural lord!
And be it known to you that I have not come to do you
harm, but have come to guard and defend you, if so be
that you return to your duty.  Now behold the rightful
heir.  If you hold with him you will be doing as you
ought, and if not, we will do to you the very worst that
we can."
</p>

<p>
But the citizens were far too much in awe of the
Emperor Alexios to show a sign of sympathy, and so they
returned to the host.
</p>

<p>
Then a terrible siege began, and for ten days both
sides fought with might and main.  One of the most
interesting incidents is thus related by the eye-witness
Geoffrey.
</p>

<p>
"Now may you hear of a strange deed of prowess; for
the Doge of Venice, who was an old man and saw naught
(seeing he was blind) stood, fully armed, on the prow of
his galley, and had the standard of St Mark before him;
and he cried to his people to put him on land, or else that
he would do justice upon their bodies with his hands.
</p>

<p>
"And so they did, for the galley was run aground,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
and they leapt therefrom, and bore the standard of St
Mark before him on the land.
</p>

<p>
"And when the Venetians saw the standard of St
Mark on land, and the galley of their lord touching
ground before them, each held himself for shamed, and
they all got to the land, and those in the transports leapt
forth and landed; and those in the big ships got into
barges, and made for the shore, each and all as best they
could.
</p>

<p>
"Then might you have seen an assault, great and
marvellous and to this bears witness Geoffrey de
Villehardouin, who makes this book, that more than forty
people told him for sooth that they saw the standard of
St Mark of Venice at the top of one of the towers, and
that no man knew who bore it thither.
</p>

<p>
"Now hear of a strange miracle.  Those that are
within the city fly and abandon the walls, and the
Venetians enter in, each as fast and as best he can, and
seize twenty-five of the towers, and man them with their
own people."
</p>

<p>
That same night, after a disgraceful retreat from a
conflict before the gates, the Emperor Alexios "took of
his treasure as much as he could carry, and of his people
as many as would go," and fled from the city.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the citizens drew the poor blind Isaac from
his dungeon, clothed him in the imperial robes, and
seating him on a high throne, did obeisance to him; after
which they hastened to tell the prince Alexios and the
barons of what had happened.
</p>

<p>
Great was the joy throughout the host.  "Him whom
God will help can no men injure," was said of young
Alexios, yet with the distrust which the Greeks always
inspired, the leaders hastened to send envoys to enquire
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
whether Isaac meant to ratify the covenant made by the
prince, his son.  With much reluctance, this was done,
though the words with which the request was received
might well be thought to ring false.
</p>

<p>
"Certes," said the Emperor, "this covenant is very
onerous, and I do not see how effect can be given to it,
nevertheless, you have done us such service, both to my
son and to myself, that if we bestowed upon you the
whole empire, you would have deserved it well."
</p>

<p>
There was now nothing else to wait for save the
coronation of the new Emperor, and when once that
was over, had their hearts been really set upon the
cause of God, they would resolutely have turned their
faces to the Holy Land.  But they had already too
lightly forsaken their high enterprise, and readily turned
away again from its fulfilment.

CHAPTER XV
<br />
  The Story of the Latin Empire<br />
  of Constantinople<br />
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  <i>Greece, change thy lords, thy state is still the same,<br />
  Thy glorious day is o'er, but not thy years of shame.</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BYRON: <i>Childe Harold.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Although the usurper had fled, the position
of the Emperor Isaac, and that of his son Alexios,
the virtual ruler, was by no means serene.  Money
had to be raised in order to pay the sum promised to the
Crusaders, and the taxes levied in consequence did not
endear them to the Turks.  They had good reason to
distrust the loyalty of their subjects, and to dread what
might happen if the Crusaders withdrew from the
neighbourhood of the city.
</p>

<p>
So the young prince Alexios, betook himself to the
camp and in his father's name used his utmost powers of
persuasion to induce the chieftains to remain.
</p>

<p>
"You have restored to me life, honour and empire,"
said he "I ought to desire but one thing more, the power
to fulfil my promises.  But if you abandon me now and
proceed to Syria, it is impossible that I should furnish
you with either the money, troops or vessels that I have
promised.  The people of Constantinople have received
me with many demonstrations of joy, but they love me
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
not the more for that.  I am hated by them because you
have restored to me my heritage.  If you forsake me,
my life or throne would probably fall a sacrifice to my
enemies.  I implore you, therefore, to defer your departure
until the March of next year, and I will promise in
return not only to provide your army with all necessary
supplies till Easter, but also to engage the Venetians to
support you with their fleet till Michaelmas."
</p>

<p>
The usual division of opinion followed, but the
supporters of the Emperor had their way, and the latter
showed his gratitude by paying large sums of money to
his allies, money that had to be raised by heavy taxes or
by selling the treasures stored in the churches.  This
measure did more than anything else to inflame the Greeks
against the Crusaders, for it lent colour to a report that
had got about, to the effect that the ancient religion of
the Greek Catholics was about to be altered in many
ways, and brought into line with that of the Church of
Rome.
</p>

<p>
It was while the young Alexios was absent on a kind of
triumphal march through his father's dominions that
the suppressed fury of the citizens was kindled into a
blaze by the rude behaviour of a handful of the Crusaders.
</p>

<p>
There was a mosque at Constantinople, which had been
built at the request of Saladin for the use of the followers
of Islam.  From this the worshippers were one day
emerging when a band of half intoxicated Flemings and
Venetians endeavoured to insult them by forcing an
entry.  The Mohammedans protected their building
with all their energy, and their opponents promptly set
it on fire.  The fire spread to the neighbouring buildings,
and the quarrel, at first a mere street-fight, grew fast and
furious.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
</p>

<p>
"No man could put out or abate that fire," says
Geoffrey, "it waxed so great and horrible.  And when
the barons of the host, who were quartered on the other
side of the fort, saw this, they were sore grieved and filled
with pity&mdash;seeing the great churches and the rich palaces
melting and falling in, and the great streets filled with
merchandise burning in the flames; but they could do
nothing."
</p>

<p>
For two days and two nights the fire lasted, and so
strong was the feeling of the city that all Latin settlers
there fled with their goods and took refuge in the
Crusaders' camp.  Again and again the fire broke out, until
from east to west its track could be marked out by one
unbroken line of destruction and desolation.  From the
height where their camp was pitched, the Crusaders could
but watch the terrible scene with dismay, knowing, as
they did, that their men had been its cause.
</p>

<p>
The return of Alexios did not mend matters.  A silence
as of death reigned in the blackened streets; looks of
hatred met him wherever the people were to be accosted.
Moreover, the fact that he had by no means fulfilled
his promises of payment to the host led to deep distrust
of him in that quarter.  Envoys were sent to demand
that the Emperor should keep his pledged word, and
their speech to him ended with these significant words.
</p>

<p>
"'Should you do so, it shall be well.  If not, be it
known to you that from this day forth, they will not hold
you as lord or friend, but will endeavour to obtain their
due by all the means in their power.  And of this they
now give you warning, seeing that they would not injure
you, nor any one, without first defiance given; for
never have they acted treacherously, nor in their land
is it customary to do so.'"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
</p>

<p>
There was but one answer to this defiance, seeing that
the Emperor could not pay even if he would.  He knew
too well that he and his son had forfeited even the natural
respect due to their position; Isaac, because he was a
mere figure-head completely in the hands of Alexios, the
real Emperor in all but name; and the latter because of
the want of dignity he had shown even in his most
friendly days, when on visiting the camp, he had
permitted the rough Venetian sailors to snatch off his
jewelled circlet and to force upon his head one of the
dirty linen caps worn by themselves.
</p>

<p>
Just at this time, too, the young prince was very much
under the influence of a certain "Mourzoufle," or "He of
the black eyebrows," as the nickname implies.  This
man, having laid his own plans in secret, strongly
advised Alexios to defy the Crusaders; and so the war
began with an unexpected piece of trickery on the part
of the Greeks.
</p>

<p>
"They took seven large ships and filled them full of big
logs, and shavings and tow and resin and barrels, and
then waited until such time as the wind should blow
strongly from their side of the straits.  And, one night,
at midnight, they set fire to the ships, and unfurled their
sails to the wind.  And the flames blazed up high, so
that it seemed as if the whole world were afire.  Thus
did the burning ships come towards the fleet of the
pilgrims and a great cry arose in the host, and all sprang
to arms on every side.  It seemed as though every ship
in the harbour would fall a victim to this device, but the
Venetians did good service on that day, turning the
burning boats out of the harbour with such skill that only one
ship was utterly destroyed."
</p>

<p>
From the walls of Constantinople the Greeks had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
watched what they hoped would be a heavy blow to the
Crusaders, who, bereft of their fleet, would not be able
to get away either by land or sea.  Great was their
dismay when they perceived that the main effect was to
rouse the pilgrims to take a desperate revenge upon them
for their dastardly deeds.
</p>

<p>
Now came forward the crafty Mourzoufle, and, whilst
pretending to act as go-between for Isaac and the French
barons, secretly stirred up a revolution in the city against
the Emperor.
</p>

<p>
Just as he had succeeded in convincing Alexios that
it was unsafe for him to have anything to do with the
Crusaders, a tumult broke out in the city.  Crowding
into the great church of St Sophia, a reckless mob
pronounced that Isaac and Alexios were deposed, and elected
an unknown and feeble-minded youth, named Canabus,
in their place.
</p>

<p>
When Alexios heard of this, he shut himself up within
the royal palace and sent messengers to Boniface,
Marquis of Montferrat imploring his help.  But while
the Marquis was generously hastening to protect him,
Mourzoufle was before him, and was whispering in the
ear of the young man that the appearance of Boniface
meant that the Latins had seized Constantinople for
their own.  His allies were busy spreading a report of
the assault of the city by the Crusaders, and when
Montferrat thundered at the gates of the palace, he was
not only refused admittance but found himself in a
position of the greatest danger from the fury of the
people who thronged the streets.
</p>

<p>
While he was fighting his way through these, the
terrified Alexios had put himself into the hands of
Mourzoufle, who promised to lead him to a place of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
safety.  This turned out to be a dungeon, from which the
unfortunate young prince was never again to emerge
alive.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of the election of poor wretched Canabus,
Mourzoufle now appealed to the people to state their will,
saying that until they made this known he was holding
captive an Emperor whose plans were not to be trusted.
A great shout from the fickle Greeks proclaimed "He
of the Black Brows," as their new choice, and he was
forthwith carried to St Sophia and crowned as Emperor.
</p>

<p>
"When the Emperor Isaac heard that his son was
taken and Mourzoufle crowned, great fear came upon
him, and he fell into a sickness that lasted no long time.
So he died.  And the Emperor Mourzoufle caused the
son, whom he had in prison to be poisoned two or three
times; but it did not please God that he should thus die.
Afterwards the Emperor went and strangled him, and
when he had strangled him, he caused it to be reported
everywhere that he had died a natural death, and had
him mourned for and buried honourably as an Emperor,
and made great show of grief."
</p>

<p>
"But," as Geoffrey further remarks, "murder cannot
be hid, and this deed of the Black-Browed only hastened
on the attack which the Crusaders were about to make
upon the city."
</p>

<p>
The aim of this second siege of Constantinople was
not merely to punish the murder of the Emperor.  The
Crusaders had resolved that, from henceforth, no Greek,
but a Latin sovereign should rule the Eastern Empire,
to be elected by an equal number of French and Venetians
acting as a committee.
</p>

<p>
One of the most interesting incidents of the siege is
told us by another chronicler, Robert of Clari.  He tells
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
us that a small troop of besiegers had come to a postern
door in the city walls which had been newly bricked up.
Amongst them was a clerk named Aleaume of Clari, who
had done more deeds of prowess than any man in the
host, "save only the Lord Peter of Bracuel."
</p>

<p>
"So when they came to the postern they began to hew
and pick at it very hardily; but the bolts flew at them so
thick, and so many stones were hurled at them from
the wall, that it seemed as if they would be buried
beneath the stones.  And those who were below held up
targets and shields to cover them that were picking and
hewing underneath; and those above threw down pots
of boiling pitch and fire and large rocks, so that it was one
of God's miracles that the assailants were not utterly
confounded; for my Lord Peter and his men suffered
more than enough of blows and grievous danger.  However,
so did they hack at the postern that they made a
great hole therein, whereupon they all swarmed to the
opening, but saw so many people above and below, that
it seemed as if half the world were there, and they dared
not be so bold as to enter.
</p>

<p>
"Now when Aleaume, the clerk, saw that no man
dared to go in; he sprang forward and said that go in he
would.  And there was present a knight, a brother to the
clerk (his name was Robert), who forbade him and said
he should not go in.  And the clerk said he would, and
scrambled in on his hands and feet.  And when the knight
saw this he took hold of him by the foot and began to drag
him back.  But in spite of this, the clerk went in.  And
when he was within, many of the Greeks ran upon him
and those on the wall cast big stones on him; and the
clerk drew his knife and ran at them; and he drove them
before him as though they had been cattle, and cried to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
those outside, to the Lord Peter and his folk, 'Sire,
come in boldly, I see that they are falling back
discomfited and flying.'  When my Lord Peter heard this they
entered in, and there was with him about ten knights and
some sixty foot soldiers, and when those on the wall saw
them they fled helter-skelter.
</p>

<p>
"Now the Emperor Mourzoufle, the traitor, was near
by, and he caused the silver horns to be sounded, and the
cymbals, and a great noise to be made.  And when he
saw my Lord Peter and his men, all on foot, he made a
great show of falling upon them, and spurring forward,
came about half-way to where they stood.  But my Lord
Peter, when he saw him coming, began to encourage his
people and to say, 'Now, Lord God, grant that we may
do well, and the battle shall be ours.  Let no one dare
to think of retreat, but each bethink himself to do
well.'  Then Mourzoufle, seeing that they would in no wise
give way, stayed where he was and then turned back
to his tents."
</p>

<p>
One likes to dwell upon such brave tales as this, that
one may the longer defer the miserable sequel of this
success.
</p>

<p>
The city was taken on the Monday of the Holy Week
of 1204, when Mourzoufle had shut himself within his
palace as a preliminary to flight at the first opportunity.
</p>

<p>
On the Tuesday, when he had fled from the Golden
Gate, the Crusaders occupied the whole city "for they
found none to oppose them."  The bishops and clergy
who were with the host had strictly charged the soldiers to
respect the churches of the city, as well as the monks and
nuns of the religious houses, but they had spoken in vain.
</p>

<p>
The taking of the city was disgraced by the most
terrible scenes of violence, cruelty, and sacrilege.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
beautiful church of St Sophia was defiled by drunken
wretches, who drained the sacred vessels from the altar,
and sang low songs where only the stately psalms and
hymns of the Eastern Church had been heard.  Not one
sacred building was spared, but rifled of its treasures; its
costly lace and beautiful carving was left bare and
desolate, too often stained with the blood of the slain.
No wonder that the Greeks regarded with utter horror
the behaviour of their fellow Christians, who had once
been so eager to urge the union of the Churches of East
and West.  Well might the pope exclaim, when he
heard of the horrible excesses, "How shall the Greek
Church return to unity and to respect for the Bishop of
Rome, when they have seen in the Latins only examples
of wickedness and works of darkness, for which they
might justly loathe them, worse than dogs?"
</p>

<p>
Nor were the churches the only objects of the spoilers.
Some of the beautiful statues, the work of Greek sculptors
in the best days of the art of Greece, were smashed to
atoms by the rough soldiers; others, of bronze, were
ruthlessly melted down into money.
</p>

<p>
Many of the inhabitants of the city fled, amongst whom
was the Patriarch, or Archbishop, who had scarcely
time to clothe himself, and was without food or money.
The misery and humiliation of the proud city of
Constantine were completed when Baldwin, Count of
Flanders, a brave young baron, but utterly out of
sympathy with Greek ideas, was crowned Emperor.
</p>

<p>
The story of the Latin empire of Constantinople
scarcely belongs to that of the Crusades.  It lasted for
fifty-seven years (1204-1261), and was marked by the
constant unrest and revolution of one part of the empire
or another.  Thus it never became firmly settled, for the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
Latin Emperor had no real power in the land.  A short
time after his election, most of the Crusaders returned to
their own homes.  Two years after the taking of the city,
both Boniface of Montferrat, leader of the expedition, and
the brave old Dandolo, Doge of Venice, died.  The latter
may perhaps be blamed as being the means of turning
aside the Crusaders from their original undertaking, the
relief of the Holy Land; but the real blame lies with
those who broke their promise to share in the expenses of
the expedition and thus forced the host to do as Dandolo
required of them.
</p>

<p>
What then had become of those faithless remnants of
the Fifth Crusade?  Their story is soon told.
</p>

<p>
One small army reached Palestine and strove to join
Bohemond of Antioch, a descendant of the famous
Crusader.  Falling into an ambush of the Saracens, the
whole of the force was massacred or taken prisoner, with
the exception of a single knight.  Another section of the
Crusaders actually reached Antioch and became absorbed
in the quarrels between Bohemond and the Christian
prince of Armenia.  Not a blow was struck for the
deliverance of Jerusalem, and nothing was gained by the
Crusade as far as the Holy War was concerned.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the Fifth Crusade has an importance
all its own; for the capture of Constantinople opened
a door to the East that had been closed too long.  Not
only did it sow the seeds of that commercial prosperity
which made Venice "hold the gorgeous East in fee, and
be the safeguard of the West," but it enabled Western
Europe to catch a glimpse of that wealth of art and
literature which were stored within the city walls, and
which were not to be spread broadcast over the land

CHAPTER XVI
<br />
The Children's Crusade
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  <i>The child spake nobly: strange to hear<br />
  His infantine soft accents clear<br />
  Charged with high meanings, did appear.</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. B. BROWNING: <i>A Vision of Poets.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
During the ten years that followed the taking
of Constantinople, Pope Innocent tried to stir
up another Crusade, which he hoped should
actually fulfil its high ideals.
</p>

<p>
But the old enthusiasm for the Holy War had died
down.  The chief kingdoms of Europe were too busy
quarrelling with one another to have leisure to think of
the distant lands of the East.  John of England was
getting into trouble both with his own people and with
the Pope himself; Philip Augustus of France was building
up his kingdom into a great and united nation; Otho
of Germany and Frederick II., grandson of Barbarossa,
the Crusader, were in fierce conflict with regard to
Germany.
</p>

<p>
While Europe was thus absorbed in more or less selfish
aims and ideals, a bitter cry for help was heard from the
East.  A terrible famine, followed by pestilence, both
caused by the failure of the Nile to overflow its banks
and fertilize the soil, had reduced the people of Palestine
and Egypt to a state of absolute misery.  Mothers were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
said actually to have killed and eaten their own babes in
their extremity of hunger, and hundreds of people simply
lay down and died by the roadside.
</p>

<p>
The extreme limit of misery and human desolation
was reached when to famine and pestilence was added
an earthquake which destroyed whole cities.  Heavy,
indeed, seemed the hand of God upon His land, and there
were not wanting many who said that He was punishing
it for past sins and present negligence, since Jerusalem
was still in the hands of the infidel.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, while Pope Innocent was vainly trying to
rouse Europe to undertake a Sixth Crusade, an astonishing
movement began to be seen amongst the children of
the different lands.  Throughout France and Germany
boy leaders drilled their little regiments, fastened on the
Cross, and prepared seriously to go forth to the Holy
War.  At first they met with opposition, and ridicule;
but such was the earnest zeal of these little people that
even the most hardened onlooker ceased to jeer or hinder.
Mothers, with aching hearts, saw their little ones march
forth, and put out no hand to prevent them, and as the
procession passed along the high roads, the children
swarmed out from cottage and castle to join the ranks.
</p>

<p>
From Germany a band of seven thousand children set
out for the port of Genoa, from whence they hoped to
embark for the Holy Land.  They were led by a boy
named Nicholas, who swayed them by the most extraordinary
power, and was almost worshipped by his little host.
</p>

<p>
But to get to Genoa, they had to cross the Alps, and
there cold and hunger left thousands of the poor mites
dead upon the mountain side.  The remnant, a sad and
sorry spectacle, ragged, starving and dirty, made its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
way at length into Genoa.  There they hoped to find
friends and help to cross the sea; but the citizens of the
port looked with scant favour upon the little Crusaders,
and the Senate ordered that they should forthwith depart
from the city.  Some wealthy inhabitants, kinder of heart
than the rest, adopted a few of the fairer and more
attractive children; a few more struggled on to Rome
to lay their cause at the feet of the Pope.  The rest,
heart-sick and weary, tried to struggle back to their
homes.  Enthusiasm was long since dead, they were
laughed at, as failures, and saddest of all, when they were
asked why they had left their homes, they now made
weary answer that "they could not tell."
</p>

<p>
Few indeed, ever saw their native land again.
</p>

<p>
Another band of German boys and girls succeeded in
reaching the port of Brindisi, where they were actually
put on board ships bound for the East.  What was their
fate remains a mystery; they were never heard of more.
</p>

<p>
The largest band of all started from Vendôme in
France, under the leadership of a nameless shepherd-boy,
who wore a little sheepskin coat and carried a
banner upon which was worked a lamb.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-197"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-197.jpg" alt="The Children crossing the Alps" />
<br />
<i>The Children crossing the Alps</i>
</p>

<p>
He seemed to possess a magic power over his playmates,
for at the sound of his clear, high young voice, hundreds
and thousands of children flocked to his banner and
received the cross from his hands.  Not even grown
persons, not even the most obstinate parent could stand
against his persuasions and entreaties.  Full of devotion,
full of zeal, the children marched upon the long road to
Marseilles, singing psalms and hymns, and crying
constantly aloud&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"O Lord Christ!  Restore to us thy Cross!"
</p>

<p>
"You know not what is before you," said the wise
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
greybeards of the villages through which they passed.
"What do you mean to do?"
</p>

<p>
"To get to the Holy Land," was the invariable and
undaunted answer.
</p>

<p>
Weary and hungry, with their ranks much thinned
by fatigue and the hardships of the way, the Child
Crusade entered Marseilles with gallant hearts.  For
they fully expected that they would find the sea cleft
asunder by a miracle, and a pathway prepared for them
to the other side.  When they found they were mistaken,
some turned their faces homeward; but most stayed to
see if by any means they could get boats to take them to
the Holy Land.  To them came presently two merchants,
Hugh Ferrens, and William Beco, or Porcus, who had
already discovered how to make a fortune by selling
European children as slaves to the Saracens.  Approaching
the eager little ones with kindly words, they offered
to lend them seven ships wherein they might be taken
across the sea to their destination.
</p>

<p>
Joyfully the children agreed and set forth with songs
and merry cries, cheered by a vast multitude who
watched them from the shore.  Of that bright-faced
band not one ever reached the Holy Land or returned
to Europe to tell the tale.  At the end of two days, two
of the ships were wrecked in a terrible storm and all on
board perished.
</p>

<p>
The rest escaped this peril, and sailed on to Alexandria
and other ports, where the poor little passengers were
landed and sold as slaves to the Saracens.  Twelve of
these are said to have won the martyr's crown, because
they preferred to die rather than renounce their faith, a
few reached the Christian city of Ptolemais after a time,
and told their sad story to the enraged inhabitants, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
rest were condemned to a life of slavery among the sons
of Islam.
</p>

<p>
Theirs is a sad story, yet we may find in it the awakening
of that spirit of devotion which seemed to have died
out in Europe.
</p>

<p>
Pope Innocent, when he heard of this Crusade, might
well say, "These children are a reproach to us for
slumbering while they fly to the succour of the Holy
Land."
</p>

<p>
From that time preparations for the Sixth Crusade
began in good earnest.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br />
  The Story of the Emperor Frederick<br />
  and the Sixth Crusade<br />
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  <i>Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,<br />
  I see the lords of human kind pass by.</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOLDSMITH: <i>The Traveller.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>
The story of the Sixth Crusade may be told in
two parts, one dealing with failure, the other
with success.  It was the tardy fruit of Pope
Innocent's urgent appeal for another Holy War, a war
which he himself would have led, had not death cut short
his career.
</p>

<p>
Curiously enough, the actual leader of the first part of
the Sixth Crusade was the king of a country whose
people had done their utmost to hinder and prevent the
First Crusaders on their march to the Holy Land.
Andrew, King of Hungary, sailed in 1216 with a large
army to Asia; and with him were the Dukes of Austria
and Bavaria.  At Acre they were joined by other
bands of Crusaders, so that in the next year four kings, of
Hungary, Armenia, Cyprus, and John of Brienne, "King
of Jerusalem," in name alone, were met together within
the city walls.
</p>

<p>
But these later Crusaders, for the most part, were made
of sorry stuff.  If Andrew had been a second Geoffrey
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
of Bouillon, he might well have restored the kingdom of
Jerusalem.  He was, however, half-hearted in the work,
and would perhaps never have undertaken it had not his
dying father laid upon him a solemn obligation to fulfil
his own vow.  Famine, too, proved a worse enemy than
the Saracens, and the latter, knowing this too well, did
not attempt to bring about an engagement.
</p>

<p>
So the Crusaders at first contented themselves with
an advance to the river Jordan, in the waters of which
they bathed, and then made a peaceful expedition
across the plains of Jericho and by the shores of the Sea
of Galilee.
</p>

<p>
Then the soldiers began to get restive, and to ask for
what reason they had come so far from their western
homes; so it was suddenly decided to attack the Saracen
castle on Mount Tabor.
</p>

<p>
The story of this attempt only serves to emphasise the
weakness and inefficiency of the leaders.  The castle
was guarded by rocky passes and steep heights, which the
Saracens defended with their usual skill and courage.
But the Crusaders had actually succeeded in driving them
from their posts and in forcing their way to the very
gates, when panic, inexplicable but complete, seized
hold upon them.  They retreated in confusion and
shame, undeterred by the reproaches of the Patriarch of
Jerusalem, who had accompanied the expedition, bearing
with him a fragment of the true Cross.  Realising,
perhaps, that he was not destined to be a hero, Andrew
of Hungary returned home, and his example was
followed by many of his fellow-pilgrims.
</p>

<p>
The hopes of John of Brienne, however, were not quite
dashed to the ground, for fresh troops of Crusaders from
France, Italy and Germany, arrived at Acre during the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
spring of 1218, and to these was soon added a little English
army under William Longsword, Earl of Salisbury.
</p>

<p>
The combined forces now determined to strike at the
Sultan first through Egypt, and urged thereto by John of
Brienne, sailed up the Nile to attack Damietta, one of the
strong fortresses which guarded that land.  The city
seemed impregnable, for it was not only surrounded by
three thick walls, but was also protected by a double wall
on the side facing the Nile, and by a tower built in the
middle of the river, from which was stretched to the
ramparts an enormously strong iron chain.
</p>

<p>
The story of this siege is intermingled with strange
legends.  A high wooden tower had been built upon
two of the Crusaders' ships, from which they hoped to
attack the river fortress, but this was quickly set on fire
by the Saracens, while the banner of the Holy Cross was
seen to drift helplessly down the stream.  The terrified
onlookers from the banks flung themselves on their
knees and implored the help of God at this crisis; upon
which it is said that the flames died down, while before
the astonished eyes of the Crusaders the banner was seen
to wave from the top of the tower in the river.
</p>

<p>
Much encouraged, they made a fresh attack with such
vigour that the enemy threw down their arms and the
tower was won.
</p>

<p>
The legend says that when the chief prisoners were
brought into the Christian camp, they asked to be shown
the troop of white clothed men bearing shining white
swords, the brilliance of whose appearance they declared
to have so dazzled their eyes that they could not see to
fight longer; and so, says the chronicler of these things,
"the Crusaders knew that the Lord Christ had sent His
Angels to attack that tower."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
</p>

<p>
While the siege of Damietta itself was still in progress,
news arrived of the death of Saphadim, the Sultan, and
of the accession of his two sons.  The "Sword of
Religion," as his Moslem followers called Saphadim, had
been a wise as well as a valiant ruler; his successors were
weak and incapable.  Aghast at the thought of losing
their famous seaport, and alarmed at the arrival of many
new pilgrims, some hailing from France, others from
England, the two young men at length sent messengers
with an offer wrung from them, they said, "because the
power of God was against them."
</p>

<p>
They promised, in fact, to give up Jerusalem and the
whole of Palestine to the Crusaders if the latter would
agree to depart at once from Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Considering that the freeing of the Holy Land from
infidel rule was the only true aim of the Crusaders, we
can only be amazed at finding that the offer was rejected.
</p>

<p>
John of Brienne, "the King of Jerusalem," was eager
enough to accept it; so too were the Knights Templars
and Hospitallers mindful of their vows.  But there
was present in the camp a certain Cardinal Pelagius,
the papal legate, who claimed, as representative of the
Pope, to have the final decision in the matter; and he,
fearing probably that the supreme power would fall
into the hands of John of Brienne, supported by the
French Crusaders and afterwards by the Knights of the
Temple and Hospital, carried the day against the Sultan,
and caused the siege of Damietta to be resumed.
</p>

<p>
Plague had already done its work within the walls, and
there remained little for the Crusaders to do.  Damietta
was theirs, and a sorry triumph it proved.
</p>

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-205.jpg" alt="John of Brienne attacking the River Tower" />
<br />
<i>John of Brienne attacking the River Tower</i>
</p>

<p>
In spite of the frank opposition of John of Brienne,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
Pelagius now determined to lead the host to the further
conquest of Egypt, and a march on Cairo began.  Once
more the terrified Sultan offered them the same terms,
and once more, being, as Philip of France contemptuously
said, "so daft as to prefer a town to a kingdom,"
they refused to give up Damietta, and pursued their way.
</p>

<p>
Too late repentance came; for the Nile rose with its
usual rapidity, the sluices were opened by the Egyptians,
the camp was surrounded by water, and baggage and
tents were washed away.  The unfortunate Crusaders,
caught in a trap, were at the mercy of their foes, and were
thankful when the Sultan, in pity, offered to let them go
free if they would surrender Damietta.  They could but
agree, since they knew that it required all the little
authority that the young Sultan had at his command
to prevent his chieftains condemning the whole host to
destruction.  As it was, the latter were perishing of
famine, and tears flowed down the cheeks of John of
Brienne, when led as hostage to the Sultan's tent, as he
remembered their distress.  With that generosity which
marks the whole family of Saladin, the Sultan, when he
discovered the cause of his grief, at once sent the starving
multitude a large store of food.
</p>

<p>
Thus in darkness and disgrace ended the first part of
the Sixth Crusade, which so far had gained nothing but
an ill reputation for the Crusaders who had taken part
in it.
</p>

<p>
The leader of the second part of the Sixth Crusade was
made of very different stuff from Andrew of Hungary or
John of Brienne.  When Frederick II., grandson of the
great Barbarossa, had been summoned, some eight years
before this time, from the leafy groves of his kingdom of
Sicily, to be emperor in place of the rebellious Otho, he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
had taken the cross and promised to lead an army to the
Holy Land at the earliest opportunity.
</p>

<p>
But Otho did not take his deposition quietly, and
during the next few years Frederick had his hands too full
in his own dominions to fulfil his vow.  After Otho's
death, two years later than that of the ambitious and
energetic Pope Innocent, the new Pope, Honorius,
besought the young Emperor to listen to the bitter cry for
help which once more came from across the sea.  At that
time, however, Frederick was completely absorbed in
ambitious schemes for himself and his family.
</p>

<p>
The Pope's influence was strong, however, and it
seemed clear that his friendship was absolutely necessary
to Frederick's schemes.  The position of the Emperor
had never been universally acknowledged in past years,
and it was now proposed that Honorius should publicly
crown Frederick at St Peter's at Rome.  This was
done in all good faith and fellowship.  "Never did Pope
love Emperor as he loved his son Frederick," said
Honorius as he parted from him after the coronation,
with the promise ringing in his ears that the German
army should be ready to start on the Crusade during the
following year.
</p>

<p>
But Frederick still delayed, for he saw little chance of
winning the glory he coveted under present conditions
in the East.  He was not going to send an army thither
merely to put John of Brienne back on the throne of
Jerusalem.  Even the news of the loss of Damietta only
served to point the moral that without a huge army,
for which time and money were absolutely necessary,
supreme success could not be achieved.
</p>

<p>
Then John of Brienne himself landed in Europe to ask
in person for the help that was so long in coming.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
brought with him his beautiful daughter, Yolande, and
her presence inspired the Pope with new hopes.  He now
proposed that the Emperor Frederick should marry the
maiden and go forth to the Holy War as the heir of John
of Brienne.  The marriage took place in 1225, more than
eleven years after Frederick's vow as a Crusader had
first been taken.  Almost immediately the Emperor
showed his real motive in the marriage by declaring that
as John held his royal rights only through his wife, they
passed on her death to her daughter, through whom they
were now held by her husband, and the Emperor therefore
at once proclaimed himself "King of Jerusalem."
</p>

<p>
Not even then, after the unavailing opposition of John
had died away, did Frederick start upon the Crusade.  In
his beautiful Sicilian kingdom, surrounded by learned
Jews, cultivated Saracens, Norman troubadours and
Italian poets, he had become too easy-going, too tolerant
of all forms of faith or of none, to have any real religious
motive to stimulate his actions.  He was, indeed,
inclined to meet even the Sultan of Egypt himself on terms
of the friendliest equality.
</p>

<p>
But Honorius had been succeeded as Pope by the proud
and domineering Gregory IX., to whom this spirit of
dallying was loathsome.  An imperative letter
summoning the Emperor to fulfil his broken vow seemed at
first to have some real effect, and in the August of 1227
a large army assembled at Brindisi.  There the men were
seized by fever, and though Frederick actually set sail
with the fleet, it was only to return after three days to the
harbour of Otranto, while the host dispersed.  The Pope
was furious, and, paying no heed to the Emperor's plea of
sickness, proceeded to excommunicate, "with bell, book
and candle," one whom he said had been nursed, tended,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
and aided by the Church, only to cheat her with false
hopes and trickery.
</p>

<p>
A pretty quarrel now arose.  Frederick appealed to
the sovereigns of Europe, declaring that his illness had
been real and that "the Christian charity which should
hold all things together is dried at its very source."
</p>

<p>
Meantime he treated the ban of excommunication
with contempt.
</p>

<p>
The Pope replied, in the ensuing Holy Week, by putting
every place where Frederick happened to visit under an
interdict, and threatening to absolve his subjects from
their allegiance if this were disregarded.  The Emperor
took no notice, but, as though to emphasise the injustice
with which he had been treated, pushed on his preparations
for the Crusade.  Setting out to Brindisi, he was
met by papal envoys who forbade him to leave Italy
until he had done penance for his offences against the
Church.  His only answer was to send his own messengers
to Rome demanding that the interdict be removed, and
meantime he set sail for Acre.
</p>

<p>
All other Crusaders had gone forth with the blessing
of the Pope and the Church; this, the most recent of them
all, came as an outcast, with the ban of the Church
upon him; and his position was bound to be affected
thereby.  The greater part of his army feared to serve
under him, and he landed with only six hundred knights,
"more like a pirate than a great king."
</p>

<p>
The military orders, the Knights of the Hospital and
the Temple also refused to acknowledge him, but the
scattered pilgrims, eager for a leader at any price, looked
upon him with favour and rallied to his standard.
</p>

<p>
But upon these broken reeds Frederick had little
intention of leaning.  From the bigoted narrowness of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
Templars and Hospitallers he gladly turned to the
polished and cultivated Sultan, Malek-Camhel, who was
quite prepared to renew friendly terms with one whom
he held in much respect.  For some time they dealt with
trifles, comparing their respective skill in verse-making
and in music.  Then the Emperor sent Camhel his
sword and cuirass, and the latter responded by a present
of an elephant, some camels, and a quantity of the rich
spices and stuffs of the East.
</p>

<p>
Becoming aware, at length, that these signs of friendship
were the cause of mutterings of discontent in the
camps both of Islam and of the Crusaders, they at length
agreed upon a truce of ten years on the following
conditions.  The towns of Joppa, Bethlehem and Nazareth
were to be given up to the Christians and the city of
Jerusalem, with one important exception.
</p>

<p>
This was the site of the Temple, where now stood the
Mosque of Omar, which was to be left to the Saracens.
</p>

<p>
So Frederick, with his knights, went up to the Holy
City, about the season of Mid-Lent, 1229, and entering
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, took the crown from
the High Altar and placed it upon his own head; "but
there was no prelate, nor priest, nor clerk, to sing or
speak."
</p>

<p>
He next visited the Mosque of Omar, and showed
clearly how little he was moved in all this by love for
his own faith.  For when the Saracens, respecting his
supposed feelings, refrained from sounding the muezzin,
or bell that calls to prayer, Frederick stopped the order,
saying, "You are wrong to fail in your duty to your
religion for my sake.  God knows, if you were to come
to my country, your feelings would not be treated
with such respect."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
</p>

<p>
The terms of this treaty enraged both the Moslems
against their Sultan and the Church against the Emperor.
</p>

<p>
At his entrance into the city, the priests and people
fled from the presence of Frederick as though from a
leper.  The very images of the saints in the churches
were draped in black; and the triumphant message of
Frederick to Gregory, claiming the gratitude of the
Church for the restoration of the Holy City, was
received with chilling silence.
</p>

<p>
Then came the startling news that the Pope had put a
large army under the leadership of John of Brienne, now
the Emperor's greatest enemy, who was about to capture
several of his Italian cities.
</p>

<p>
Hastening to Acre, and well aware of the hostility of
those who considered themselves defrauded of the chance
of killing the Saracens, Frederick called a great meeting
of pilgrims in the plain outside the city.  To them he
spoke strongly against the mischief caused by the clergy
and the Templars in trying to stir up strife, and ordered
all the pilgrims, who had now fulfilled their vows, to sail
at once for Europe.
</p>

<p>
Frederick returned to his western lands in 1229, and
though he lived till 1250, he never again saw his kingdom
of Jerusalem.  He had never been a true Crusader at
heart, and had not stayed long enough to establish his
eastern domain on any firm foundation; but he had,
nevertheless, accomplished within a few months what
others had failed to do in as many years, and that
without any attempt at bloodshed.

<p>
The ten years' truce made by Frederick II. with

kept by either side.
</p>

<p>
The smaller Moslem states did not hesitate to attack
the Christian towns whenever they saw an opportunity of
so doing, and the Templars, who had been from the first
entirely against the terms of the truce, continued to fight
against the Sultan until, in a pitched battle, they lost
their Grand Master and nearly all their adherents.
</p>

<p>
This occurrence was seized upon hi Europe as the
opportunity to stir up a Seventh Crusade.  A leader
was soon found in the person of Theobald, Count of
Champagne and King of Navarre, a renowned
"troubadour" and one of the most skilful minstrels and
accomplished knights of his day.
</p>

<p>
Theobald had begun his career as a rebel to the
child-king, Louis IX. of France, and aspired to become the
leader of that large number of discontented barons who
hoped to obtain their independence of the royal power.
But the heart of the rebel was touched by the womanly
devotion and courage of the young Queen-mother under
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
these trying circumstances.  He became her true and
loyal knight, and, in obedience to her desire, assumed
the Cross and prepared for a Crusade.  All his wealth,
all his influence was used for this purpose, and many of
the rebellious barons were prevailed upon to follow his
example.
</p>

<p>
Just as Theobald and his company were prepared to
start from the town of Lyons, a message arrived from
Pope Gregory, urging them to give up their project and
return to their homes that they might hold themselves
in readiness when he should call in their aid in affairs
more pressing than those of the Holy Land.  The chief
of these was the defence of Constantinople, now ruled
by Baldwin, son of John of Brienne, who had implored
his aid against the attacks of Greeks and Bulgarians;
another, scarcely less important, was the violent quarrel
between himself and Frederick.
</p>

<p>
But the French Crusaders were little in sympathy with
the ambitious projects of Gregory.  They had taken up
the Cross with a definite aim, and remembering what had
happened in the days of the Fifth Crusade, they would
not be deterred by side issues.
</p>

<p>
They left Europe torn with fierce political and religious
conflicts only to find Syria in the same condition.
</p>

<p>
The Saracen princes were waging war upon each other
as well as upon the Christians, and the unhappy people
of both religions had to bear the brunt.
</p>

<p>
Hearing that the Sultan had already seized Jerusalem,
some of the Crusaders determined to revenge themselves
by an attack upon the territory round Gaza.  In vain
Theobald urged them to act together and not to waste
their strength; they pushed on until they came to a
region shut in by barren sand-hills, where they alighted
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
to rest.  Suddenly the silence of the desert was broken
by the shrill notes of war-music, and the shouts of the
foe.  Beset on all sides, a few managed to escape; the
rest remained to sell their lives or freedom dearly, and
incidentally to weaken the forces of Theobald of Navarre
by their loss.
</p>

<p>
The blow was a crushing one, and Theobald seemed
now to lose all heart.  A vain attempt was made to
negotiate a treaty which both sides would accept.  All
was in confusion, and during the turmoil Theobald
quietly retired from the scene with his men, and went
home, confessedly a failure.
</p>

<p>
The position of the Sultan himself, however, was little
less difficult.  He was beset by civil strife within his
dominions, and when a more dreaded adversary appeared
upon the scene he was in no condition to offer
effective resistance.  The new-comer was Richard, Earl of
Cornwall, a namesake and nephew of Richard Lion-heart,
whose name was still a terror to the children of
Islam.  The reputation of the English Earl as a redoubtable
man of war had preceded him, and the Sultan showed
great anxiety to come to terms.  He offered almost
immediately to surrender all prisoners and the Holy
Land itself, and to this Richard readily agreed.
</p>

<p>
For the third and last time the Latin kingdom of
Jerusalem was established, and for the next two years
it remained in Christian hands.  Then, just as Pope
Innocent IV. succeeded Gregory IX., came a terrible
rumour of a new and more dangerous foe than the
Saracens.
</p>

<p>
"In the year 1240," says Matthew of Paris, "that
human joys might not long continue, an immense horde
of that detestable race of Satan, the Tartars, burst forth
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
from their mountain regions and making their way
through rocks almost impregnable, rushed forth like
demons loosed from hell; and over-running the country,
covering the face of the earth like locusts, they ravaged
the eastern countries with lamentable destruction,
spreading fire and slaughter wherever they went."
</p>

<p>
Descending upon the region of the Caspian lake, they
drove out the no less savage shepherd people of that
district, and these hurled themselves upon Syria.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever stood against them was cut off by the
sword or dragged into captivity; the military orders were
almost exterminated in a single battle; and in the pillage
of the city, in the profanation of the Holy Sepulchre, the
Latins confess and regret the modesty and discipline of
the Turks and Saracens."
</p>

<p>
Such is the gloomy picture painted by Gibbon of
this terrible invasion.  Christians and Moslems for the
first time fought side by side against the foe they had in
common, but they could do nothing.  The army left to
guard Jerusalem, as well as all the inhabitants, save the
old and sick, fled at sight of the savage hordes, who,
nevertheless, by a cruel trick obtained their fill of slaughter.
</p>

<p>
Entering the city they hoisted the Cross and the flags
of the Crusaders upon the walls of the Holy City, and
rang the bells of the different churches all at once.
</p>

<p>
The Christians heard, paused in their headlong flight,
and seeing the red cross flag streaming from the citadel,
cried, "God has had mercy on us and has driven away
the barbarians."
</p>

<p>
Thousands of them at once returned, and directly they
had entered their homes, the foemen rushed upon them
from secret hiding-places and killed or threw into prison
every person they found.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
</p>

<p>
In a great pitched battle fought near Gaza the allied
armies of the Moslems and the Christians were almost
entirely destroyed.  Amongst the prisoners was the Prince
of Joppa, who was forthwith led before the walls of his
own city, placed upon a cross, and threatened with instant
death if he would not command his people to surrender.
But this brave man only cried to the men upon the
walls, "It is your duty to defend this Christian city,
and mine to die for Christ," and so, rather than surrender,
he suffered death at the hands of a howling mob.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, Joppa was taken, and every other
Christian city; and not until the rulers of Egypt and Syria
united with each other as well as with the few Christians
left, was there any hope of driving the invaders from the
land.  But even when this was at length accomplished
the Holy City remained in the hands of Islam, and all
that the Seventh Crusade had accomplished was entirely
swept away.

CHAPTER XIX
<br />
  The Crusade of St Louis<br />
  (The Eighth Crusade)<br />
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  <i>Some grey crusading knight austere<br />
  Who bore St Louis company<br />
  And came home hurt to death....</i><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MATTHEW ARNOLD: <i>A Southern Night.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A hundred years earlier, the news of the
destruction of Jerusalem would have stricken
all Europe with horror and roused her to action.
It was not so now.  That earlier fervour of religion
which had sent pilgrims rejoicing to an almost certain
death had died away, and had been replaced by a more
practical form of faith which found its outlet in a zeal for
converting the souls of men, and healing their bodies,
rather than in a thirst for the blood of infidels.
</p>

<p>
In the narrow dirty lanes of cities the inspired monk
or eager friar was still to be found; but the followers of
St Francis of Assisi or St Dominic were soldiers of the
Cross in a more Christ-like, if a less military, spirit than
Peter the Hermit or Bernard of Clairvaux, and stirred
up the people rather to cleaner and healthier lives than
to take arms for the Holy War.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the sovereigns of Europe at this time, of whom
Frederick II. was a fair example, there yet remained one
of the old type, one who was filled with the purest zeal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
for religion mingled with the desire to win glory as became
a true knight.
</p>

<p>
This was Louis IX. of France&mdash;the St Louis of the
Eighth Crusade&mdash;who, if he accomplished nothing towards
establishing Christian rule in the Holy Land, yet
remains to us in history as an example of the very few who
took up the Cross and carried on the war, inspired only
by holy and unselfish motives.
</p>

<p>
"Louis and his fair queen appear, indeed, as brilliant
stars, shining through the blackness of a sky overcast
with clouds; but they could not dispel the darkness, or
lend more than a transitory gleam of brightness to
illumine the gloomy prospects."[<a id="chap19fn1text"></a><a href="#chap19fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap19fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap19fn1text">1</a>] W. E. Dutton.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
King Louis found a devoted hero-worshipper and
chronicler in the Sire de Joinville, a great French noble,
who accompanied him upon the Eighth Crusade, and
whose story will often be told here in his own words.
</p>

<p>
Louis IX. came to the French throne at no easy time,
for he was but a boy of ten, and the powerful French
barons were eager to win their independence of the royal
power.  But they found their match in the Queen
Regent, Blanche of Castile, who, for the first time, put her
dependence upon the people of her land, and trusted to
them to defend their young king against the rebellion
of the nobles.  She also, as we have seen, won over to her
side Count Theobald of Champagne, by whose help the
rebels were soon forced to yield, and who, for love of her,
afterwards became one of the leaders in the Seventh
Crusade.
</p>

<p>
The young Louis was brought up by her more as a
monk than a king, and, as he grew older, his own tastes
turned entirely in the same direction.  "You are not a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
king of France," cried a woman who was trying to win his
favour in an unjust cause, "you are a king only of
priests and monks.  It is a pity that you are king of
France.  You ought to be turned out."
</p>

<p>
"You speak truly," was the gentle answer, "it has
pleased God to make me king; it had been well had He
chosen some one better able to govern this kingdom
rightly."
</p>

<p>
Yet he was one of France's wisest rulers, taking a personal
interest in the troubles of her people that was rare,
indeed, in those days.
</p>

<p>
"Ofttimes it happened that he would go, after his
mass, and seat himself in the wood of Vincennes, and
lean against an oak, and make us sit round him.  And
all those who had any cause in hand came and spoke
to him, without hindrance of usher or any other
person.  Then would he ask, out of his own mouth, 'Is
there anyone who has a cause in hand?'  And those
who had a cause stood up.  Then would he say, 'Keep
silence all and you shall be heard in turn, one after the
other.'  And when he saw that there was anything to
amend in the words of those who spoke on their own
behalf, or on behalf of any other person, he would himself,
out of his own mouth, amend what he had said."
</p>

<p>
His love of justice is seen in his answer to the Pope,
when Gregory, after a second violent quarrel with the
Emperor Frederick, had deposed him and offered the
crown to Louis' brother.  Gentle as was the King's usual
speech, he replies now, "Whence is this pride and
daring of the Pope, who thus disinherits a king who has
no superior nor even an equal among Christians&mdash;a king
not convicted of the crimes laid to his charge?  To us
he has not only appeared innocent, but a good neighbour;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
we see no cause for suspicion either of his worldly
loyalty or of his Catholic faith.  This we know, that he
has fought valiantly for our Lord Christ both by sea and
land.  So much religion we have not found in the Pope,
who endeavoured to confound and wickedly supplant
him in his absence, while he was engaged in the cause of
God."
</p>

<p>
There can be no doubt that it was in his character as a
Crusader that Frederick mainly attracted Louis, for he
had little else in common with him.  For a long time the
French King nursed in secret his desire to follow his
hero's example, since his mother would not hear of his
deserting his own kingdom.  But at length the clear call
came.
</p>

<p>
"It happened, as God so willed, that a very grievous
sickness came upon the king in Paris, and brought him
to such extremity that one of the ladies who was tending
him wished to draw the cloth over his face, saying he was
dead; but another lady, who was on the other side of the
bed, would not suffer it, saying that the soul was still in
his body.  And as he listened to the debate between these
two ladies, Our Lord wrought within him and soon sent
him health, for before that he had been dumb and could
not speak.
</p>

<p>
"And as soon as he could speak, he asked that they
should give him the Cross, and they did so.
</p>

<p>
"When the queen, his mother, heard that speech had
come back to him, she made as great joy thereof as ever
she could.  But when she knew that he had taken the
Cross&mdash;as also he himself told her&mdash;she made as great
mourning as if she had seen him dead."
</p>

<p>
Not even his mother's grief could hinder this ardent
soldier of the Cross, whose chief wish now was to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
persuade his nobles to follow him.  At the Christmas of
that year he presented each of his barons with a new
robe.  When these were put on, they were found to have
the red cross embroidered between the shoulders.  The
wearers had "taken the cross," and must accompany
their king.
</p>

<p>
Two years were spent in preparing supplies, and at the
end of the year 1248, King Louis, with the Queen, his
wife, embarked and sailed to Cyprus, where he remained
until the spring of 1249.  On landing in Egypt at the
Point of Limesol, he met with a strange occurrence.
</p>

<p>
"The king," says Joinville, "landed on the day of
Pentecost.  After we had heard mass, a fierce and
powerful wind, coming from the Egyptian side, arose in
such sort, that out of two thousand eight hundred
knights, whom the king was taking into Egypt, there
remained no more than seven hundred whom the wind
had not separated from the king's company, and carried
away to Acre and other strange lands, nor did they
afterwards return to the king of a long while."
</p>

<p>
This sounds like a story from the "Arabian Nights,"
and one can understand the King's haste to escape, with
the remnant left him, from the region of this mysterious
wind of the desert.  So he sailed to Damietta, "and we
found there, arrayed on the seashore, all the power of
the Sultan&mdash;a host fair to look upon, for the Sultan's
arms are of gold, and when the sun struck upon them
they were resplendent.  The noise they made with their
cymbals and horns was fearful to listen to."
</p>

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-223.jpg" alt="The Landing of St Louis in Egypt" />
<br />
<i>The Landing of St Louis in Egypt</i>
</p>

<p>
Waiting only until he saw his ensign of St Denis safe
on shore, "the king went across his ship with large steps,
and would not leave from following the ensign, but leapt
into the sea, which was up to his arm-pits.  So he went,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
with his shield hung to his neck, and his helmet on his
head, and his lance in his hand, till he came to his people
who were on the shore."
</p>

<p>
Seized with panic at the sight of the many brave
ships and the landing of the Crusaders, the garrison of
Damietta fled without striking a blow.  Says Joinville,
"The Saracens sent thrice to the Sultan, by
carrier-pigeons, to say that the king had landed, but never
received any message in return, because the Sultan's
sickness was upon him.  Wherefore they thought that
the Sultan was dead, and abandoned Damietta.
</p>

<p>
"Then the king sent for all the prelates of the host,
and all chanted with a loud voice, <i>Te Deum laudamus</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Afterwards the king mounted his horse, and we all
likewise, and we went and encamped before Damietta."
</p>

<p>
There they remained until they were joined by the
King's brother, the Count of Poitiers; and after that a
march was made upon Babylon, "because, if you wanted
to kill the serpent, you must first crush its head."
</p>

<p>
Now when they tried to cross the delta of the Nile,
which at that part of Egypt lies between four "branches"
of the river, they encamped between the stream that
flows to Damietta, and that which flows to Tanis, and
found the whole host of the Sultan lying upon the farther
side of the latter, and ready to defend the passages.
</p>

<p>
The King at once gave orders to build a causeway
across the river; but as fast as this was made the
Saracens dug holes and let in the water which had been
dammed up, thus washing away the work.  They constantly
harassed the camp also, and tried to cut off the
French army in the rear; and when they began to use
Greek fire also, the hearts of the Crusaders began
somewhat to quail.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
</p>

<p>
"The fashion of the Greek fire was such that it came
frontwise as large as a bottle of verjuice, and the tail of
fire that issued from it, was as large as a large lance.
The noise it made in coming was like Heaven's own
thunder.  It had the seeming of a dragon flying through
the air.  It gave so great a light because of the great
abundance of fire making the light, that one saw as
clearly through the camp as if it had been day....
</p>

<p>
"When my Lord Walter, the good knight who was
with me, saw this, he spoke thus: 'Lord, we are in the
greatest peril that we have ever been in, for if they
set fire to our towers and we remain here, we are but
lost and burnt up; while if we leave these defences
which we have been sent to guard, we are dishonoured.
Wherefore none can defend us in this peril save God
alone.  So my advice and counsel is, that every time they
hurl the fire at us, we throw ourselves on our elbows and
knees, and pray to our Saviour to keep us in this peril....'
</p>

<p>
"Every time that our saintly king heard them hurling
the Greek fire, he would raise himself in his bed, and lift
up his hands to Our Saviour, and say, weeping, 'Fair
Lord God, guard me my people.'
</p>

<p>
"And verily I believe that his prayers did us good
service in our need.  At night, every time the fire had
fallen, he sent one of his chamberlains to ask how we
fared, and whether the fire had done us any hurt."
</p>

<p>
At length, when things were getting very serious for
the Crusading army, there came a Bedouin, or Arab of the
desert, to the camp, and offered to show them a ford over
the river if they would pay him five hundred besants.
</p>

<p>
Risky as was the undertaking&mdash;for the offer might
have been a mere piece of treachery, with the object of
placing the host in an entirely unprotected position, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
of drowning most of their number&mdash;the King decided in
its favour, and determined to lead the way, with his
three brothers, across the ford.
</p>

<p>
"Then, as the dawn of day was appearing, we
collected from all points and came to the Bedouin's
ford; and when we were ready we went to the stream
and our horses began to swim.  When we got to the
middle of the stream, we touched ground and our horses
found footing; and on the other bank of the stream
were full three hundred Saracens, all mounted on their
horses.
</p>

<p>
"Then said I (the Sire de Joinville) to my people,
'Sirs, look only to the left hand, and let each draw
thither; the banks are wet and soft, and the horses are
falling upon their riders and drowning them.'  Thereupon
we moved in such sort that we turned up the stream and
found a dry way, and so passed over, thank God! that
not one of us fell; and as soon as we had passed over,
the Turks fled."
</p>

<p>
But disaster was at hand.  The Templars had been
given the post of honour in the vanguard, and close after
them came the Count of Artois, brother to the King, with
his men.
</p>

<p>
"Now it so happened that as soon as the Count of
Artois had passed over the stream, he and all his people
fell upon the Turks, who had fled before them.  The
Templars notified to him that he was doing them great
despite in that, while his place was to come after them,
he was going before them, and they besought him to suffer
them to go before, as had been arranged by the king.
Now it chanced that the Count of Artois did not venture
to answer them because of my Lord Foucaud of Merle,
who held the bridle of his horse; and this Foucaud of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
Merle was a very good knight, but heard naught of what
the Templars were saying to the Count, seeing that he
was deaf, and was all the while crying, 'Out on them!
Out on them!'
</p>

<p>
"Now when the Templars saw this, they thought
they would be shamed if they suffered the Count to
outride them, so they struck spurs into their horses,
helter-skelter, and chased the Turks, and the Turks fled
before them, right through the town of Mansourah and
into the fields beyond towards Babylon.
</p>

<p>
"But when the Crusaders thought to return, the Turks
threw beams and blocks of wood upon them in the streets,
which were narrow.  There were killed the Count of
Artois, the Lord of Couci, who was called Raoul, and so
many other knights that the number was reckoned at
three hundred.  The Temple, as the Master has since
told me, lost there fourteen score men-at-arms, and all
mounted."
</p>

<p>
The whole blame of this disastrous affair must be laid
at the door of the Count of Artois, in spite of Joinville's
attempt to put it on the shoulders of Lord Foucaud.
When the Grand Master of the Templars had warned
the Count of the risk of pursuing men who had but given
way to a moment's panic, the latter openly accused him
of treachery.
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose," cried the Master, "that we have
left our homes and our substance and taken the habit
of a religious in a strange land, only to betray the Cause
of God and to forfeit our salvation?"
</p>

<p>
And with that he prepared to go to almost certain
death.  Then William Longsword, son of the Earl of
Salisbury, did his best to turn the Count from such a
course of destruction, and was met with insult.  "See
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
how timid are these tailed English!  It would be well
if the army were purged of such folk!"  "At least,"
returned Longsword, "we English to-day will be where
you will not dare to touch our horses' tails."
</p>

<p>
Longsword fell that day with his face to the foe, Artois,
in trying to escape, and the whole force must have been
destroyed had not the King's division come to the rescue,
while Joinville, who tells the tale, managed to hold the
bridge across to the town.  Says the latter, "We were
all covered with the darts that failed to hit the
sergeants.  Now it chanced that I found a Saracen's
quilted tunic lined with tow: I turned the open side
towards me and made a shield of it, which did me good
service, for I was only wounded by their darts in five
places, and my horse in fifteen.  And it chanced again
that one of my burgesses of Joinville brought me a
pennon with my arms and a lance head thereto, and every
time that we saw that the Turks pressed too hardly upon
the sergeants, we charged them and they went flying.
</p>

<p>
"The good Count of Soissons, in that point of danger,
jested with me, and said, 'Seneschal, let these curs
howl!  We shall talk of this day yet, you and I, in
ladies' chambers.'"
</p>

<p>
At sunset, when the King's crossbow men came up, the
Saracens fled, and Joinville, hastening to Louis,
conducted him with loving care to his tent.  "And as we
were going, I made him take off his helmet, and lent him
my steel cap, so that he might have air.
</p>

<p>
"When he had passed over the river, there came to
him Brother Henry, Provost of the Hospitallers, and
kissed his mailed hand.  The king asked if he had any
tidings of the Count of Artois, his brother, and the
Provost said that he had news of him indeed, for he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
knew of a certainty that his brother, the Count of Artois,
was in Paradise.
</p>

<p>
"'Ah, sire,' said the Provost, 'be of good comfort
therein, for never did King of France gain such honour
as you have gained this day.  For, in order to fight your
enemies, you have passed swimmingly over a river, and
you have discomfited them, and driven them from the
field, and taken their war-engines and also their tents,
wherein you will sleep this night.'
</p>

<p>
"Then the king replied, 'Let God be worshipped for
all He has given me!' but the big tears fell from his
eyes."
</p>

<p>
In spite of the Provost's cheering words, the King's
army was still in a position of great danger.  That very
night an attack was made upon the camp, which was
but the first of a series of attacks which cut Louis off
entirely from Damietta and forced him to retreat to the
"Island."
</p>

<p>
"When I was laid in my bed," says Joinville, "when
indeed I had good need of rest because of the wounds
received the day before&mdash;no rest was vouchsafed to
me.  For before it was well day, a cry went through the
camp, 'To arms!  To arms!'  I roused my chamberlain,
who lay at my feet, and told him to go and see what
was the matter.  He came back in terror, and said,
'Up, lord, up: for here are the Saracens, who have come
on foot and mounted, and discomfited the king's sergeants
who kept guard over the engines, and have driven them
among the ropes of our tents.'
</p>

</p>

<p>
"I got up and threw a tunic over my back and a steel
cap on my head, and cried to our sergeants, 'By St
Nicholas, they shall not stay here!'  My knights came
to me, all wounded as they were, and we drove the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
Saracens from among the engines, and back towards a
great body of mounted Turks."
</p>

<p>
A day or two later, the Saracens, encouraged by the
sight of the bloodstained coat of arms belonging to the
Count of Artois, which they were told was that of the
King, and that Louis was now dead, came together in a
great battle against the French host.  In this fight so
many on both sides were killed that the river was full of
the dead.
</p>

<p>
Then a worse thing fell upon them, for, says Joinville,
"because of the unhealthiness of the land&mdash;where it
never rains a drop of water&mdash;there came upon us the
sickness of the host, which sickness was such that the
flesh of our legs dried up and the skin became spotted,
black and earth colour, like an old boot; nor could
anyone escape from this sickness without death."
</p>

<p>
Famine followed, for the Turks had cut off all sources of
supplies from Damietta; and, in desperation, an attempt
to treat with the enemy was made.  The conditions
proposed were that Louis should give up Damietta in return
for the kingdom of Jerusalem; and when the Saracens
asked what pledge they offered that they should regain
the port, the French offered them one of the King's
brothers.
</p>

<p>
They promptly replied that they would be satisfied
with no one but the King himself, whereupon, "my Lord
Geoffrey of Sargines, the good knight, said he would
rather that the Saracens should have them all dead or
captive than bear the reproach of having left the king in
pledge."
</p>

<p>
When Louis saw that there was no alternative but
death or retreat, since none of his officers would agree
that he should be given up, he once more gave the order
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
to try to return to Damietta.  The King could have
easily escaped thither by means of a little boat, but he
would not abandon his people, many of whom were very
sorely sick.  But Louis himself was weak with illness,
so that he could scarcely sit upon his horse; yet he
persisted in trying to guard the river banks while
Joinville and others got the sick men on board.  What
happened then was told by Louis himself to his
faithful friend.  "He told me that of all his knights and
sergeants there only remained behind with him my Lord
Geoffrey of Sargines, who brought him to a little village,
and there the king was taken.  And, as the king related
to me, my Lord Geoffrey defended him from the Saracens
as a good servitor defends his lord's drinking-cup from
flies; for every time that the Saracens approached, he
took his spear, which he had placed between himself
and the bow of his saddle, and put it to his shoulder and
ran upon them, and drove them away from the king.
And then they brought the king to the little village; and
they lifted him into a house, and laid him, almost as one
dead, in the lap of a burgher-woman of Paris, and
thought he would not live till night."
</p>

<p>
Thus did Louis fall into the hands of the Saracens, and
was left in sorry plight indeed.  He was sufficiently
conscious to beg Lord Philip de Montfort to try once
again to make terms of peace, but while this was being
done, "a very great mischance happened to our people.
A traitor sergeant, whose name was Marcel, began to
cry to our people, 'Yield, lord knights, for the king
commands you; and do not cause the king to be
slain!'
</p>

<p>
"All thought that the king had so commanded, and
gave up their swords to the Saracens.  The Emir (the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
officer of the Sultan), saw that the Saracens were bringing
in our people prisoners, so he said to my Lord Philip
that it was not fitting that he should grant a truce, for
he saw very well that we were already fallen into his
hands."
</p>

<p>
Meantime Joinville and his men had fared no better
by water than his comrades had by land.  He himself,
indeed, had the narrowest possible escape from death,
and was only saved by the generosity of a Saracen, whose
former dealings with Frederick II. of Germany had made
him favour the Crusaders.  Joinville was exceedingly
weak and ill, but as his boat was in mid-stream he hoped
to escape to Damietta with those of the sick whom he
had been able to rescue.
</p>

<p>
"My people," says he, "had put on me a jousting
hauberk, so that I might not be wounded by the darts
that fell into our boat.  At this moment my people,
who were at the hinder point of the boat, cried out to
me, 'Lord, Lord, your mariners, because the Saracens
are threatening them, mean to take you to the bank!'  Then
I had myself raised by the arms, all weak as I
was, and drew my sword on them, and told them I
should kill them if they took me to the bank.  They
answered that I must choose which I would have;
whether to be taken to the bank, or anchored in
mid-stream till the wind fell.  I told them I liked better
that they should anchor than that they should take me
to the shore where there was nothing before us save
death.  So they anchored.
</p>

<p>
"Very shortly after we saw four of the Sultan's
galleys coming to us, and in them full a thousand men.
Then I called together my knights and my people,
and asked them which they would rather do, yield to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
Sultan's galleys or to those on land.  We all agreed that
we would rather yield to the galleys, because so we should
be kept together, than to those on land, who would
separate us and sell us to the Bedouins.
</p>

<p>
"Then one of my cellarers said, 'Lord, I do not agree
in this decision.'  I asked him to what he did agree,
and he said to me, 'I advise that we should all suffer
ourselves to be slain, for then we shall go to
Paradise.'  But we heeded him not."
</p>

<p>
When Joinville saw that he must be taken either way,
he threw his casket of jewels into the river, and turned
to find one of his mariners urging, "Lord, if you do not
suffer me to say you are the king's cousin they will kill
you all, and us also."  So he told him he could say what
he pleased.  The sailor at once cried out loud, "Alas,
that the king's cousin should be taken!" with the
result that the Saracens on the nearest galley at once
anchored near their boat.
</p>

<p>
But help of an unexpected kind was at hand.  A
Saracen, who had lived on land in the East belonging
to the Emperor Frederick, swam aboard, and throwing
his arms round Joinville's waist, said, "Lord, if you do
not take good heed you are but lost; for it behoves you
to leap from your vessel on to the bank that rises from
the keel of that galley; and if you leap, these people will
not mind you, for they are thinking only of the booty
to be found in your vessel."
</p>

<p>
So he leapt, but so weak was he that he tottered
and would have fallen into the water had not the
Saracen sprung after him and held him up in his arms.
</p>

<p>
A rough reception awaited him, however, for they
threw him on the ground and would have killed him had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
not the Saracen held him fast in his arms, crying "Cousin
to the King!"
</p>

<p>
He was certainly in sorry case, for he had no clothing
save for the steel hauberk, which the Saracen knights,
pitying his condition, exchanged for a fur-lined coverlet
and a white belt, in which he girt himself for lack of
proper clothes.  Still under the protection of "his
Saracen," Joinville saw with sad eyes the slaughter of
the sick upon the bank and in the boats, and was himself
subjected to a sore trial of faith.  For his protector, who
was evidently a man of some authority, tried to tempt
him to embrace the religion of Islam by causing all his
mariners to be brought before him, telling him that they
had all denied their faith.
</p>

<p>
"But I told him never to place confidence in them,
for lightly as they had left us, so lightly, if time and
opportunity occurred, would they leave their new
masters.  And he answered that he agreed with me; for
that Saladin was wont to say that never did one see a
bad Christian become a good Saracen, or a bad Saracen
become a good Christian.
</p>

<p>
"After these things he caused me to be mounted on
a palfrey and to ride by his side.  And we passed over a
bridge of boats and went to Mansourah, where the King
and his people were prisoners.  And we came to the
entrance of a great pavilion, where the Sultan's scribes
were; and there they wrote down my name.  Then my
Saracen said to me, 'Lord, I shall not follow you further,
for I cannot; but I pray you, lord, always to keep hold
of the hand of the child you have with you, lest the
Saracens should take him from you.'"
</p>

<p>
Truly, in his case, for the sick and sorry Joinville, as
well as for the protection he provided for the little lad,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
the "child called Bartholomew," that unknown Saracen
showed himself worthier of the name of Christian than
many of those who fought under the banner of the Cross.
</p>

<p>
When the French lord entered the pavilion with his
little charge, he found it full of his brother barons, "who
made such joy that we could not hear one another speak,
for they thought they had lost me."
</p>

<p>
Joy was soon turned to grief, however, for many of
their number were taken by the Saracens into an
adjoining courtyard and asked, "Wilt thou abjure thy faith?"
</p>

<p>
"Those who would not abjure were set to one side, and
their heads were cut off, and those who abjured were set
on the other side."
</p>

<p>
Then the Sultan sent to ask what terms they were
willing to make.  "Would you give, for your deliverance,
any of the castles belonging to the barons oversea?"  But
they replied that they had no power over these
castles, which belonged to their sovereign King.  Then
he asked if they would surrender any of the castles
belonging to the Knights Templars and Hospitallers.  But
they answered that this could not be, for when the knights
of the Temple or the Hospital were appointed to these
castles, they were made to swear, on holy relics, that they
would not surrender any of them for man's deliverance.
</p>

<p>
"The council of the Sultan then replied that it seemed
to them that we had no mind to be delivered, and that
they would go and send us such as would make sport of
us with their swords, as they had done of the others
belonging to our host.  And they went their way."
</p>

<p>
With Louis himself the counsellors of the Sultan had
gone still further, threatening him with torture if he did
not do as they willed.  "To their threats the King
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
replied that he was their prisoner, and that they could do
with him according to their will."
</p>

<p>
Finding that they could not terrorise the King they
came back to him once more and asked how much money
he was willing to pay for a ransom, besides giving up
Damietta.
</p>

<p>
To this Louis replied that if the Sultan would accept
a reasonable sum, he would see if the Queen would pay it
for their deliverance.  This answer, to those who held
the Eastern idea of women, was astounding, and they
asked, "How is it that you will not tell us definitely that
these things shall be done?"  To which Louis replied,
with spirit that he did not know if the Queen would
consent, seeing that she was his lady, and mistress of her
own actions.  Then they took counsel with the Sultan,
and brought back word that if the Queen would pay five
hundred thousand <i>livres</i> (about £405,000) he would
release the King.
</p>

<p>
"And when they had taken the oath that this should
be so, the King promised that he would willingly pay
the five hundred thousand <i>livres</i> for the release of his
people, and surrender Damietta for the release of his own
person, seeing that it was not fitting that such as he
should barter himself for coin."
</p>

<p>
When the Sultan heard this, he said.  "By my faith,
this Frank is large-hearted not to have bargained over
so great a sum!  Now go and tell him that I give him
a hundred thousand <i>livres</i> towards the payment of the
ransom."
</p>

<p>
The prospects of the unfortunate Crusaders seemed
therefore to be brightening, when, as they were being
conveyed down the river to the Sultan's camp as a
preliminary to being set free, all was suddenly darkened
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
again by the murder of their generous captor at the hands
of some of his own traitorous Emirs.
</p>

<p>
One of these, indeed, came to King Louis, with the
heart of the Sultan, all reeking with blood, in his hand,
and said: "What wilt thou give me?  For I have slain
thine enemy, who, had he lived, would have slain thee!"
</p>

<p>
"But the King answered him never a word."
</p>

<p>
Nothing now but death seemed the probable fate of
the despairing prisoners, who meantime, were thrown
into the hold of the galley and "so pressed together that
my feet came against the good Count Peter of Brittany,
and his came against my face."
</p>

<p>
But the Saracen Emirs seem to have thought that more
profit could be made out of them alive than dead, and
were ready to observe the terms already proposed, if the
King would renew his oath to this effect, "that if he did
not observe his covenant he should be as dishonoured as a
Christian who denies God and His law, and who spits
upon the Cross and tramples on it."
</p>

<p>
Though he fully meant to keep his word, the pious soul
of Saint Louis revolted against so blasphemous a
declaration, and he absolutely refused to take such an oath.
They threatened him with instant death, but he replied
tranquilly that he "liked better to die as a good Christian
rather than to live under the wrath of God."
</p>

<p>
By the exercise of further fiendish cruelty the Saracens
attained their object.  They took the old white haired
Patriarch of Jerusalem, and tied him to the pole of the
pavilion with his hands behind his back, and so tightly
"that the said hands swelled to the size of his head, and
that the blood started from between the nails."  Then
the Patriarch cried to the King, "Sire, for the love of God,
swear without fear; for seeing that you intend to hold to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
your oath, I take upon my own soul whatsoever there
may be of sin in the oath that you take."
</p>

<p>
It seems certain that by his firmness and courage Louis
had earned the respect and admiration of the Saracens.
Joinville says that they wanted to make him their Sultan,
and only desisted because they said he was the most
steadfast Christian that could be found.  "They said
that if Mohammed had suffered them to be so maltreated
as the King had been, they would never have retained
their belief in him; and they said further that if their
people made the King to be Sultan, they would have to
become Christians, or else he would put them all to death."
</p>

<p>
In spite of this, however, their fate still hung in the
balance, for some recalled the precept of Mohammed,
"For the assurance of the faith, slay the enemy of the
law."
</p>

<p>
But better counsels prevailed, and on the day after
Ascension Day, in the year 1250, all were released save
the Count of Poitiers, who remained as hostage till
the ransom should be paid.
</p>

<p>
Many of the Crusading barons no sooner regained their
ships than they set sail for France, but the King remained
behind, to see that the ransom was paid.  In connection
with this ransom Joinville tells us of an incident that
marks even more emphatically Louis' upright character.
</p>

<p>
"When the money had been counted, there were those
of the council who thought that the King should not hand
it over until he had received his brother back.  But the
King replied that he would hand it over, seeing that he
had agreed with the Saracens to do so, and as for the
Saracens, if they wished to deal honestly, they would also
hold to the terms of their agreement.  Then Lord Philip
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
of Nemours told the King that they had miscounted,
by ten thousand <i>livres</i>, to the loss of the Saracens
(but without their knowledge).
</p>

<p>
"At this the King was very wroth, and said it was his
will that the ten thousand <i>livres</i> should be restored, seeing
he had agreed to pay two hundred thousand before he
left the river.
</p>

<p>
"Then I touched Lord Philip with my foot, and told
the King not to believe him, seeing that the Saracens were
the wiliest reckoners in the whole world.  And Lord
Philip said I was saying sooth, for he had only spoken
in jest, and the King said such jests were unseemly
and untoward.  'And I command you,' said the King
to him 'by the fealty that you owe me as being my
liegeman&mdash;which you are&mdash;that if these ten thousand
<i>livres</i> have not been paid, you will cause them to be paid
without fail.'"
</p>

<p>
Nor would Louis listen to those who advised him to
leave the river on account of its proximity to the Saracens,
and go to his ship, which waited for him out at sea.
But he had promised his foes not to go away until the
payment had been made, and no considerations of
personal safety would induce him to break his word.
</p>

<p>
"So soon, however, as the ransom was paid, the King,
without being urged thereto, said that henceforth he was
acquitted of his oaths, and that we should depart thence,
and go to the ship that was on the sea.  Then our galley
was set in motion, and we went a full great league before
we spoke to one another, because of the distress in which
we were at leaving the Count of Poitiers In captivity.
</p>

<p>
"Then came Lord Philip of Montfort in a galleon, and
cried to the King: 'Sire!  Sire!  Speak to your brother,
the Count of Poitiers, who is on this other ship!'  Then
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P243"></a>243}</span>
cried the King 'Light up!  Light up!' and they did
so.  Then was there such rejoicing among us that greater
could not be.  The King went to the Count's ship, and
we went too.  A poor fisherman went and told the
Countess of Poitiers that he had seen the Count released,
and she caused twenty <i>livres</i> to be given to him."
</p>

<p>
Nor was Louis the only star to shine in the dark
firmament of the Eighth Crusade.  All those anxious weeks
there lay at Damietta the poor young Queen, in terrible
anxiety for the fate of her husband, and for the future of
those who were with her in the city.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of her grief and trouble was born her little
son Tristan, the "child of sorrow," and he was but a day
old when she heard that all the men of the five cities of
Italy, who were with her in the city, were minded to flee
away.  With heroic courage she sent for them to her
bedside and urged them not to leave Damietta to its fate,
for if so the King would be utterly lost.
</p>

<p>
To this they replied: "Lady what can we do?  For
we are dying of hunger in this city?"  But she told them
that for famine they need not depart, "for," said she
"I will cause all the food in this city to be bought, and
will keep you all from henceforth at the King's charges."
</p>

<p>
Thus did the brave Queen keep Damietta until it had
to be given up according to the terms of the treaty; upon
which she went to Acre, there to await the King.
</p>

<p>
The release of the prisoners was, for all practical
purposes, the end of the ill-fated Eighth Crusade, but Louis
could not bear to return to France without even a glimpse
of the Holy Land which lay so very near his heart.
</p>

<p>
His brother had deserted him, but the faithful Joinville
was still at his side, and with the latter was now to be
found the little child, Bartholomew, who had in so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
strange a manner been placed under his protection.  There
were not wanting those who urged the King to return to
France, and look after the affairs of his kingdom, but
Louis was firm.  The Queen Mother, Blanche, was well
able to fill his place, and he was determined not to leave
the kingdom of Jerusalem while any hope remained of
striking a blow on its behalf.  Again and again he had
urged Henry III. of England to bring an army to its relief,
he had even promised to give up Normandy if he would
do this; and he could scarcely believe that he would
persist in his refusal.  If he should fail there was yet a
faint hope that the Pope himself might lead an army in
the cause of God; while there was the slightest chance,
therefore, he would hold himself ready to act.
</p>

<p>
So Louis went first to Acre to rejoin his Queen, and
then set to work to rebuild the fortifications of the
seaports, Cæsarea, Joppa, and Sidon, which had been
destroyed by the Saracens, though they were still ruled
by Christian chieftains.  And then four more years
passed away.
</p>

<p>
It was while Louis was engaged in fortifying Joppa that
he was told that the Sultan was willing that he should
go to Jerusalem under a "sure and safe conduct."  It
was the King's dearest wish to visit the Holy Sepulchre,
but after grave consideration, acting on the advice of his
council, he determined not to do so.  His reason was the
same as that of Richard of England in the Third Crusade.
"For if he, the greatest Christian King, went a pilgrimage
without delivering the city from God's enemies, then
would all other kings and pilgrims, coming thereafter,
rest content with going on pilgrimage after the same
manner as the King of France, and give no heed to the
deliverance of Jerusalem."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P245"></a>245}</span>
</p>

<p>
A pilgrimage in sackcloth to Nazareth was all, therefore,
that the king would allow himself, and meantime
his hopes of aid from Europe grew fainter and fainter.
</p>

<p>
Then came bad news from France.  Queen Blanche,
who seems to have been more to the king than wife or
children, was dead, and Louis must return to his deserted
kingdom.  On St Mark's day (April 24th) of the year
1254, the king and queen sailed from Acre, but they were
not destined to reach France without further adventures.
</p>

<p>
"On the Saturday we came in sight of the Isle of
Cyprus, and of a mountain in Cyprus which is called the
Mountain of the Cross.  That Saturday a mist rose from
the land, and descended from the land to the sea; and
by this our mariners thought we were further from the
Isle of Cyprus than we were, because they did not see
the mountain above the mist.  Wherefore they sailed
forward freely and so it happened that our ship struck
a reef of sand below the water; and if we had not found
that little sandbank where we struck, we should have
struck against a great mass of sunken rocks, where our
ship would have been broken in pieces, and we all
shipwrecked and drowned.
</p>

<p>
"As soon as our ship struck, a great cry rose in the
ship, for each one cried 'Alas!' and the mariners and
the rest wrung their hands because each was in fear of
drowning.
</p>

<p>
"When I heard this, I rose from my bed where I was
lying, and went to the ship's castle with the mariners.
As I came there, Brother Raymond, who was a Templar
and master of the mariners, said to one of his varlets:
'Throw down the lead.'  And he did so.  And as soon
as he had thrown it, he cried out and said.  'Alas, we
are aground!'  When Brother Raymond heard that, he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P246"></a>246}</span>
rent his clothes to the belt, and took to tearing out his
beard, and to crying: 'Ay me!  Ay me!'"
</p>

<p>
In marked contrast to this not very helpful master of
mariners stands one of Joinville's knights who "brought
me, without a word, a lined overcoat of mine, and threw
it on my back, for I had donned my tunic only.  And I
cried out to him, and said, 'what do I want with your
overcoat that you bring me, when we are drowning?'  And
he said to me, 'By my soul, lord, I should like
better to see us all drowned than that you should take
some sickness from the cold, and so come to your
death.'"
</p>

<p>
An effort was made to get the king off the threatened
ship by means of the galleys, but the latter held off; and
in this they acted wisely, seeing there were full eight
hundred persons on board the ship who would have
jumped into the galleys to save their lives, and thus have
caused the latter to sink.
</p>

<p>
Morning came and found the ship fast aground, and
seeing there was much damage done to her keel, the
servants of the king implored him to embark in another
vessel.  By his decision Louis showed once again that
wonderful unselfishness which forms one of his best
claims to the title of Saint.
</p>

<p>
After hearing the opinion of the master mariners, and
his nobles, he called together the seamen and said to
them.
</p>

<p>
"I ask you, on your fealty, whether, if the ship were
your own, and freighted with your own merchandise,
you would leave her?"
</p>

<p>
And they replied all together "No!" for they liked
better to put their bodies in peril of drowning than to buy
a new ship at great cost.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P247"></a>247}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Why then," asked the king, "do you advise me to
leave the ship?"
</p>

<p>
"Because," said they, "the stakes are not equal.  For
neither gold nor silver can be set against your person and
the persons of your wife and children who are here;
therefore we advise you not to put yourself or them in
danger."
</p>

<p>
Then the king said, "Lords, I have heard your opinion
and that of my people, and now I will tell you mine, which
is this: If I leave the ship there are in her five hundred
people and more who will land in this Isle of Cyprus, for
fear of peril to their body&mdash;since there is none that does
not love his life as much as I love mine&mdash;and these,
peradventure, will never return to their own land.
Therefore I like better to place my own person, and my wife,
and my children in God's hands than do this harm to the
many people who are here."
</p>

<p>
Their next adventure might have been more serious,
at least for some of the crew.  Sailing away in
comparative safety in the damaged ship they came at length
to the island of the sea called Pentelema, which was
peopled by Saracens who were subjects of the King of
Sicily and the King of Tunis.
</p>

<p>
"The queen begged the king to send thither three
galleys to get fruit for the children; and the king
consented, and ordered the masters of the galleys to go
thither, and be ready to come back to him when his ship
passed before the island.  The galleys entered into a
little port that was on the island; and it chanced that
when the king's ship passed before the port, we got no
tidings of the galleys.
</p>

<p>
"Then did the mariners begin to murmur among themselves.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P248"></a>248}</span>
</p>

<p>
"The king caused them to be summoned, and asked
them what they thought of the matter.  The mariners
said it seemed to them that the Saracens had captured
his people and his galleys.
</p>

<p>
"'But we advise and counsel you, sire, not to wait
for them; for you are between the kingdom of Sicily
and the kingdom of Tunis, which love you not at all.  If,
however, you suffer us to sail forward, we shall, during
the night, have delivered you from peril, for we shall
have passed through the strait.'
</p>

<p>
"'Truly,' said the king, 'I shall not listen to you, and
leave my people in the hands of the Saracens without
at least, doing all in my power to deliver them.  I
command you to turn your sails and we will fall upon them.'
</p>

<p>
"And when the queen heard this, she began to make
great lamentation and said, 'Alas! this is all my doing!'
</p>

<p>
"While they were turning the sails of the king's ship
and of the other ships, we saw the galleys coming from
the island.  When they came to the king, the king
asked the mariners why they had tarried; and they
replied that they could not help themselves, but that the
fault lay with certain sons of burgesses of Paris, of whom
there were six, who stayed eating the fruit of the gardens,
wherefore they had been unable to get them off, nor could
they leave them behind.
</p>

<p>
"Then the king commanded that the six burghers' sons
should be put into the barge a-stern; at which they
began to cry and to howl, saying, 'Sire, for God's sake,
take for ransom all that we have, but do not put us there,
where murderers and thieves are put; for we shall be
shamed to all time.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P249"></a>249}</span>
</p>

<p>
"The queen and all of us did what we could to move
the king; but he would listen to none of us.
</p>

<p>
"So they were put into the barge, and remained there
till we came to land; and they were there in such danger
and distress that when the sea rose, the waves flew over
their heads, and they had to sit down, lest the wind
should carry them into the sea.
</p>

<p>
"And it served them right; for their gluttony caused
us such mischief that we were delayed for eight good
days, because the king had caused the ships to turn right
about."
</p>

<p>
So at length Louis came to his own land of France; but
his heart was full of longing for the "holy fields" of
Palestine, and he was not content to live a life of luxury
at the court while Jerusalem was yet in the hands of the
infidel.
</p>

<p>
"After the king returned from overseas, he lived in such
devotion that never did he wear fur of beaver or grey
squirrel, nor scarlet, nor gilded stirrups and spurs.  His
clothing was of camlet and blue cloth, the fur on his
coverlets and clothing was deer's hide, or the skin from
the hare's legs, or lambskin.  He was so sober in his
eating that he never ordered special meats outside what
his cook prepared; what was set before him that did he
eat.  He put water to his wine in a glass goblet, and
according to the strength of the wine he added water
thereto by measure; and would hold the goblet in his
hand while they mixed water with his wine behind his
table.  He always caused food to be given to his poor,
and after they had eaten, caused money to be given to them."
</p>

<p>
Thus, for the next fifteen years the king fulfilled the
duties of his royal position in France; and all the while
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P250"></a>250}</span>
the voice of the East was calling, calling with insistent
voice, as news of lost cities, quarrels between those who
should have united themselves against the Saracens,
and invasions of new and hostile races reached his ears.

CHAPTER XX
<br />
The Story of the Fall of Acre
</h3>

<p class="intro">
<i>"Because the chasuble is of red serge," said he,
"that signifies that this
Crusade shall be of little profit."</i>
<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LE SIRE DE JOINVILLE: <i>Memoirs of St Louis.</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
During the interval between the Eighth and
Ninth Crusades, affairs in the Holy Land had
gone from bad to worse.
</p>

<p>
The knights of the Hospital and Temple spent all their
time in private quarrels and combats, and the merchants
of Genoa and Pisa followed their evil example.  The
Moguls were continually harassing both Saracens and
Christians, and when they were driven out by the
combined forces of the two latter, the Sultan Bibars took the
opportunity to seize the few towns that were left when
the Crusade was over.
</p>

<p>
Nazareth was almost destroyed, Cæsarea, Joppa and
Antioch fell, Acre was sorely threatened.  In vain did
Jerusalem call upon the Pope for help; his attention was
fixed, not on Palestine but on Constantinople, where the
Latin Empire had vanished, and a new Greek dynasty
had been set up under Michael Palæologus.  Absorbed
in his desire to gain acknowledgment from this quarter,
Clement IV. gave only half-hearted encouragement
to a Ninth Crusade, yet he did succeed in stirring up
enthusiasm in a somewhat unexpected quarter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P252"></a>252}</span>
</p>

<p>
To England, still in the turmoil of the Baron's War,
came the message of Clement reminding Henry III. of
his old promise to take up the Cross; and the answer
came, not from Henry, the inert and ineffective king, but
from young prince Edward, his eldest son, moved
perhaps rather by the expediency of employing his
treasonable barons than by a keen desire for the freedom
of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
One there was, however, who needed no urging, and had
no base motives in his longing to start upon a Ninth
Crusade.  Saint Louis, as we have seen, had left his heart
behind him in the Holy Land, and when he summoned all
his barons to Paris in the Lent of 1267, it was not hard
to guess the reason.
</p>

<p>
Among those who responded to the call went the Sire
de Joinville, and, seeing how well he knew the mind of
the king, it was no wonder that he should dream on the
night of his arrival that he saw Louis on his knees, before
an altar, whilst many prelates, duly vested, placed upon
his shoulders a red chasuble of Rheims serge.  Calling
his chaplain, a very wise man, Joinville told him of the
vision, and the priest at once said:
</p>

<p>
"Lord, you will see that the king will take the Cross
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Joinville asked why he thought so; and he answered
that it was because of the dream; for the chasuble of
red serge signified the Cross; which was red with the
blood that Christ shed from His side and His feet and
His hands.  "And because the chasuble is of Rheims
serge," said he, "that signifies that the Crusade shall be
of little profit, as you shall see if God gives you life," for
Rheims serge was but poor and common material, and
worth but very little.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P253"></a>253}</span>
</p>

<p>
So Joinville went to the king's chapel, and heard two
knights talking there, one to the other.  Then one said,
"Never believe me if the king is not going to take the
Cross here!"
</p>

<p>
And the other made answer, "If the king takes the
Cross, this will be one of the most dolorous days that
ever were in France.  For if we do not take the
Cross we shall lose the king's favour; and if we
take the Cross we shall lose God's favour, because
we shall not take it for His sake but for the sake of
the king."
</p>

<p>
"So," adds Joinville, tersely, "it happens that on the
following day the king took the Cross, and his three sons
with him; and afterwards it befell that the Crusade
was of little profit, according to the prophecy of my
priest."
</p>

<p>
With this second expedition of Louis, Joinville himself
had scant sympathy.  He refused to join it on the ground
that he owed a higher duty to his own poor and ruined
people.  And he held that those who advised the King
to go "seeing how weak he was of body, for he could
bear neither to drive nor to ride," were guilty of
mortal sin.
</p>

<p>
"So great was his weakness that he suffered me to carry
him in my arms from the mansion of the Count of
Auxerre, where I took leave of him, to the abbey of the
Franciscans.  And yet, weak as he was, if he had
remained in France, he might have lived longer and done
much good and many good works."
</p>

<p>
However that might have been, Louis' work as a
Crusader was well-nigh over.  He left France accompanied
by the Kings of Navarre and Aragon, and by many
of his barons, and by sixty thousand of his men.  Driven
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P254"></a>254}</span>
by a tempest to Sardinia, the leaders decided to turn
aside to Tunis, whose king was suspected of being
willing to become a Christian.  Landing on the site of
the ancient town of Carthage, they had but pitched
their tents when a plague of sickness broke out in the
camp, and the King and his son were the first to be
struck down.
</p>

<p>
When he knew that his end drew very near, St Louis
caused himself to be laid upon a bed of ashes, in token
of his penitence, and all through that last night they
heard him murmur at intervals, with longing in his
voice, "Jerusalem!  Jerusalem!"
</p>

<p>
But resignation to the Will of God was not difficult
to a man whose character had been formed by a life of
prayer and unselfish devotion.
</p>

<p>
"I will enter Thy house, O Lord, I will worship in Thy
sanctuary," were the words of joy upon his lips, as he
breathed his last.
</p>

<p>
"And it was at the same hour that the Son of God
died upon the Cross for the world's salvation," says
Joinville, who adds, moreover, the following touching
tribute to the good king.
</p>

<p>
"A piteous thing and worthy of tears is the death of
this saintly prince, who kept and guarded his realm so
holily and loyally, and gave alms there so largely, and set
therein so many fair foundations.  And, like as the scribe
who, writing his book, illuminates it with gold and
azure, so did the said king illuminate his realm with the
fair abbeys that he built, and the great number of
alms-houses, and the houses for preachers and Franciscans,
and other religious orders.  And his bones were put in
a casket and borne thence, and buried at St Denis, in
France, where he had chosen his place of burial."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P255"></a>255}</span>
</p>

<p>
With St Louis died the deep religious side of the
Crusades.  Other kings had vague longings and desires,
but none of them were driven to take part in the Holy
War by the same fervent wish to lay down their lives for
the Cause of God.
</p>

<p>
The work was now taken up by Edward, eldest son of
the English King, Henry III.  With him marched the
great English nobles who had so lately been involved in
the Barons' War; for Edward's main motive was to
keep them employed and deprive them of opportunities
for further rebellion.
</p>

<p>
Edward reached Tunis about seven weeks after the
death of Louis, and found the camp in much disorder.
The French barons were intent upon forcing the King of
Tunis to pay tribute to the Sicilian sovereign, son of their
late ruler, and were quite averse from proceeding at once
on the Crusade.  They all decided at length to go to
Sicily for the winter, but the French Crusaders said
openly that they wished the expedition deferred for at
least four years.  The death of the king and queen of
Navarre and of the young queen of Louis' successor
Philip the Bold, threw a gloom over their retreat, and
before long all the French host returned to their native
land.
</p>

<p>
Edward alone remained firm to his purpose, and in
the following spring, with his little force of seven
thousand men, he landed in Palestine.  His first act
was one of terrible revenge.  Marching to Nazareth
he took the town and put the Saracen inhabitants to
the sword.
</p>

<p>
He then returned to Acre, only just in time to save the
city from a Turkish raid; and there he seems to have had
some curious intercourse with the Emir of Joppa, who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P256"></a>256}</span>
pretended that he was anxious to become converted to
Christianity.
</p>

<p>
But sickness fell upon Edward, and as he lay upon his
bed, an assassin, sent as a bearer of letters from the Emir,
gained admittance and struck the prince in the shoulder
with a poisoned dagger.
</p>

<p>
Weak as he was, Edward had enough strength in
reserve to grapple with the fellow, wrest the dagger
from him and stab him to the heart.  Doubtless
the skilful nursing of his devoted wife, Eleanor, restored
the prince to health, whether or no the story is true that
she sucked the poison from the wound at the risk of her
own life.  The chronicles of the time give the credit to
a clever young English doctor who cut away the poisoned
flesh, but, however that may be, Edward had seen
enough of the Holy Land to realise that his task was
both dangerous and hopeless.  When, therefore, letters
from England urged his return on the score of his father's
failing health, he hastened to make a ten years' truce
with the Sultan, and to set out upon his homeward
journey.
</p>

<p>
After his departure the old state of things was revived
in the Holy Land.  None knew who was in truth the
rightful king, even in name, of the ill-fated kingdom of
Jerusalem.  The two great military orders of the
Hospital and the Temple spent their time and energies
in fighting with one another over their supposed rights;
and the commercial rivalry of the Christian settlers from
Genoa, Venice and Pisa, kept up a constant state of civil
war which left them at the mercy of their enemies.  In
Acre, the one important town held by Christian rulers,
so much fighting went on between the Christian
inhabitants that much of the city had been quite destroyed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P257"></a>257}</span>
</p>

<p>
Yet Acre was now the one hope, the one centre of
Christianity in the Holy Land.  To her walls had fled
all those who had managed to escape when one town
after another fell before the victorious march of the
Sultan.
</p>

<p>
And so it came about that the city was filled with a
mixture of nationalities, each of which claimed to be
ruled by a separate authority.  It was at one time
governed by no less than seventeen rulers, "whence
there sprang much confusion."
</p>

<p>
This wretched state of things did nothing more than
stir up a feeling of mild uneasiness in Europe.  Pope
Gregory X., indeed, did his best to encourage a new
Crusade, for he had been an eye-witness in Acre of the
need of some active measure of reform.  But he died
before anything practical could be done.  Some years
later the Grand Master of the Templars made his way to
the footstool of Pope Nicholas IV., and pleaded the cause
of the hapless Christians.
</p>

<p>
The Pope, much moved, sent seventeen hundred
mercenaries, or hired soldiers, at his own cost, to the relief
of Acre; but these men, finding their wages were not
paid, took to plundering the Saracen traders during a time
of truce, and so earned for the Christians a worse
reputation than ever.
</p>

<p>
These outrages, moreover, excited the indignation of
the Egyptian Sultan, who prepared to attack Acre in the
following spring, and meantime sent ambassadors to
demand the surrender of the truce-breakers "under pain
of open war."  The Master of the Temple would have
yielded to the justice of his demands, but the other
political parties in the city were against any such idea,
saying that it had always been the custom for the princes
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P258"></a>258}</span>
of the West to disregard any truce that might be of
force in the East.
</p>

<p>
The views of the latter prevailed, and an embassy was
sent to the Sultan, offering compensation, and assuring
him that the offenders should be kept in prison till the
truce had expired.
</p>

<p>
The Sultan Khalil listened in grim silence, and after a
while replied with much dignity, "Your words are as the
honey and sugar used to conceal the presence of a deadly
poison.  We have ourselves kept the truce with loyal
intent, but such an offence cannot be suffered to pass
unpunished.  You may depart in full assurance that
within the time appointed I will come against your city
with a mighty host and destroy all, from the least to the
greatest, by the sword."
</p>

<p>
Just before the return of the envoys with this
threatening message, the spirits of the citizens had been
much revived by the arrival in Palestine of Sir Otho de
Grandison, the secretary and confidential friend of
Edward I., with a small force and the information that
Edward himself would shortly follow him.
</p>

<p>
The message of the envoys had filled the city with panic
that was but slightly leavened with hope.  They saw
at length that their one chance lay in united action, and
they determined to fight together for their city to the
last.  "And surely the princes oversea will send us
timely help when they hear with what peril we are
encompassed," was their cry.
</p>

<p>
Encouraged by their wish for unity the Patriarch sent
them to their homes with the charge, "Be ye therefore
constant, and ye shall behold the great help of the Lord
come upon you."
</p>

<p>
So at length, when it was too late, all manner of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P259"></a>259}</span>
energies were set to work.  The city was refortified, a
large store of arms was laid in, help was sent from Cyprus
and the Islands of the Sea, until a force of nine hundred
knights and eighteen thousand foot was within the walls.
The care of the walls themselves was divided between
Otho de Grandison, Henry, King of Cyprus, and the
Master of the Teutonic Knights and the Masters of the
Temple and the Hospital, with whom served the Masters
of the Knights of the Sword and of the Knights of the
Holy Ghost.
</p>

<p>
"These are the men," says one of the narratives of the
survivors, "by whose prudence and counsel the city was
to be governed.  Had they been of one heart and mind,
Heaven is our witness, Acre would still rejoice in the
fulness of her strength."  For alas, the old discord
between the Templars and the Hospitallers had broken
out afresh, and there was little hope of united action
within the walls.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of March, the Saracens first appeared
before Acre, "while making the earth to tremble at the
march of their mailed men and to shake at the noise of
their drums and cymbals; while the gilded shields of
the soldiers flashed as the rays of the sun across the hills
and their spearheads danced in the sunlight like stars in
the midnight sky."
</p>

<p>
The din made before the walls was incessant.  "They
bellowed like bulls; they barked like dogs; they roared
like lions; and ever, as is their wont, they drummed
their huge tom-toms with their heavy-knotted
sticks."
</p>

<p>
Then the war-engines were set up "which poured by
day and by night a ceaseless hailstorm of stones upon
the walls and city."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P260"></a>260}</span>
</p>

<p>
A partly successful sortie returned with some captives
and the news that "the arrows were flying thicker than
the flakes of snow in winter"; and on the Good Friday
of the year 1291 Otho and the Templars planned a more
united attack upon the Saracen camp.  But this the
Patriarch, acting on the advice of traitors, absolutely
forbade, and so the last chance of saving the ill-fated
city disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Many of the citizens and some of the fighting men now
fled from Acre whenever they had the opportunity, but
a considerable force yet remained, quite enough indeed
to hold the city had they been content to work together.
This, however, seemed impossible, and Khalil went boldly
on to undermine the walls.  The first direct assault was
aimed at that section which was guarded by Henry of
Cyprus, and only the nightfall prevented the Saracens
from forcing an entrance.  During the hours of darkness
the King of Cyprus, with all his followers, crept to the
harbour and secretly sailed away to his own island.  And
this he did, not so much in fear as in despair of ever
accomplishing aught, when the petty quarrels and
rivalries within the city left him without support.
</p>

<p>
This fatal policy of disunion was even more apparent
during the last four days of that terrible siege.  The
Templars would not lift a hand to aid the Hospitallers;
their bitter hostility made them more eager to fight
each other than the infidel.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the Saracens had bridged the moat,
broken through the outer walls, and driven the defenders
to the inner part of the city.  The captains, who
were sitting in council, hastily donned their armour
and rode forth into the midst of the panic-stricken
crowd.

<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P263"></a>263}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Shame upon you!" they cried.  "Fools! you are
not hurt.  To the battle with you, by the faith of
Christ," and with Matthew de Clermont at their head,
they charged upon the invaders and drove them out
beyond the breach.
</p>

<p>
For three days this sort of thing continued, the
Crusaders patching up the breach by night that had been
broken in by day.  But at daybreak of Friday, May 18,
Khalil made his final assault.  In the midst of the
deafening noise made by his drummers mounted on three
hundred camels, an attack was made upon all parts of
the wall at once.  Within a few hours the Masters of the
Temple and the Hospital, rivals in life, were united in
death.  Overwhelmed by their loss, the Christians gave
way, and though Otho de Grandison held out for
awhile, it was soon clear that further resistance was
impossible.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of the horror and confusion of the onrush
of the Saracens through the doomed town, a terrific storm
began to rage, while the sea rose to such a height that it
became almost impossible to launch a boat or escape from
the harbour.
</p>

<p>
The Patriarch had been carried aboard his own galley
against his will, and in his wish to save as many of his
people as possible, he allowed the vessel to be so
overcrowded that she overturned, and all on board were
lost.  Many, however, did escape by water, and
only a few, who had no desire save for righteousness,
"remained behind to sell their lives dearly
or to bargain with Saracen prisoners for their own lives."
</p>

<p>
Others held out in the Temple Tower, and when
at length it fell, perished amid the ruins.  Otho de
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P264"></a>264}</span>
Grandison was among those who managed to escape to
Sidon, and afterwards to Cyprus.
</p>

<p>
So fell the last remnant of the Kingdom of Jerusalem,
founded with such pride and devotion nearly two hundred
years before.

<p>
No story of the Crusades can be complete without
some account of the last scene in the drama
that had been played for so many years between
East and West, and which was ended for the time when
Constantinople fell.
</p>

<p>
Since the year 1261, the Eastern Empire had passed out
of the hands of Latin rulers, and once more owned an
Emperor of Greek origin, Michael Palæologus by name.
But this fact brought it no accession of vigour or strength.
Worn out and impoverished, and lacking a great ruler
who would have held the scattered threads of Empire in a
firm grasp, the power of Constantinople was bound to lie
at the mercy of a determined foe.
</p>

<p>
She had been already threatened, about the middle of
the thirteenth century, by the dreaded Moguls, and only
escaped because the latter first turned their attention to
Russia.  But the way to her final destruction was laid
open by Michael the Emperor himself.
</p>

<p>
The borders of the Greek Empire in Asia had been
guarded for many years past by the natives of Bithynia,
the border state, who held their lands on condition
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P266"></a>266}</span>
that they kept the castles of the frontier in a state
of defence.
</p>

<p>
Their task was no easy one, for the Seljukian Turks,
who ruled over the neighbouring district of Iconium, were
always on the watch to enlarge their boundaries; but
these border militia were very faithful to their task, and
had kept the invaders at bay.
</p>

<p>
Now Michael, formerly the Regent, had won the
imperial throne by foul treachery towards the child
Emperor, John Ducas, whose eyes he put out and whom
he left to languish for thirty years in a wretched dungeon.
Uneasy lies the usurper's head, and Michael could not
rest until he had disarmed or got rid of all those
who were suspected of loyalty towards the throne of Ducas.
</p>

<p>
Among these latter were the native "militia men" of
Bithynia, whom Michael now proceeded to disband.  The
force substituted to defend the borderland was quite
inadequate for the task; and the weakest spot on the
frontier was thus left practically unguarded.
</p>

<p>
A few years earlier, a certain Othman, a Turk, had
become the vassal of the Seljukian Sultan, and had been
granted a district of the Phrygian highlands, on the very
borders of the Greek Empire, on condition that he would
take up arms against the Greeks.
</p>

<p>
Not many years passed before Othman, through the
death of the last Sultan of the Seljuk line, had stepped
into his place as an independent prince and the future
founder of the Ottoman Empire.  He outlived Michael
Palæologus and his successor, and managed before his
death to push the frontiers of the Turkish Empire
forward to the Sea of Marmora.
</p>

<p>
His son Orkhan completed the conquest of Bithynia&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P267"></a>267}</span>
comparatively easy task now that the mistaken policy of
the Greek Emperors had turned the troops of "hardy
mountaineers into a trembling crowd of peasants without
spirit or discipline."
</p>

<p>
By the year 1333, nothing remained of the Greek
Empire in Asia but the town of Chalcedon and the
strip of land that faced Constantinople across the
straits.
</p>

<p>
The rule of the Ottoman Turks over their newly-conquered
territory was firm and just enough, and was
strengthened by material drawn from the ranks of the
vanquished inhabitants.  One of their demands was that
a yearly tribute of young boys should be paid to them
by the Christians.  At first a terrible rumour spread that
these children were killed and eaten by the infidels.  But
what really happened was that these boys were trained
very carefully as soldiers, and became the "Janissaries,"
or "New Soldiers" of the Ottoman army, against whom
nothing could stand.  They were forced, of course, to
become followers of Islam, and they were appointed to
all the highest offices of state.  But their chief energy
was reserved for the attacks made upon the land of their
origin.
</p>

<p>
Gradually the Ottoman Turks crept nearer and nearer
the heart of the Eastern Empire.  A certain crafty Prime
Minister of Constantinople, John Cantacugenus, in his
determination to supplant his young sovereign, a child
of nine, actually called in their aid and allowed them
to over-run Thrace.
</p>

<p>
By the time that the usurper had won his way as
joint ruler with his master, to the imperial throne, all
that remained of the coveted empire was Constantinople,
the towns of Adrianople and Thessalonica, and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P268"></a>268}</span>
Byzantine province in the Peloponnesus.  His fatal
alliance with the Turks had been cemented by a marriage
between the Sultan Orkhan and his daughter Theodora;
and when John Palæologus, the rightful sovereign,
refused to submit to this arrangement of twin rulers,
Cantacugenus at once called in his son-in-law to his
help.
</p>

<p>
Once more the Ottomans swarmed into Thrace, and,
though they found that Cantacugenus had been deposed
and forced to become a monk, they were not disposed
to retreat without some substantial indemnity.  They
seized upon and settled in a province of Thrace, and
within two years had the whole district, together with
the city of Adrianople, in their hands.
</p>

<p>
The next step was to the threshold of Constantinople
itself, but for this the Turkish chieftain Murad was
content to wait awhile.  The capital was bound to fall
in time, and he was first of all eager to make sure of his
ground in Asia Minor.
</p>

<p>
During Murad's reign he extended his domain to the
Balkans and up to the very walls of the imperial city;
whilst the unhappy Emperor without an empire was
thankful to escape for the present by acknowledging his
supremacy, and even by taking up arms at his command
against one of his own free towns.
</p>

<p>
For the next hundred and fifty years the Ottomans
were only hindered from the invasion of Christendom
by the determined action of the Servians and
Hungarians.  And meantime the chance of freeing the
Greek Empire altogether from Ottoman rule had come
and gone.
</p>

<p>
In 1402, when the Turkish Sultan Bajazet was pressing
hard upon Constantinople, the great Tamerlane, chief
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P269"></a>269}</span>
of the Tartar hordes, who had already conquered Persia,
Turkestan, Russia, and India, came down like a
thunderbolt upon the ambitious plans of Bajazet.  The latter
defied the conqueror, saying, "Thy armies are
innumerable?  Be they so!  But what are the arrows of the
flying Tartar against the scimitars and battle-axes of
my firm and invincible Janissaries?"
</p>

<p>
Alike in their religious faith and in their ambitions,
these two men now became deadly rivals; but not even
the "New Army" of the Ottoman could stand against
the Tartar hordes.
</p>

<p>
One city after another fell and was sacked; Bajazet
himself was taken, and imprisoned, according to one story,
in an iron cage.  Another and more modern version says
that the great Tamerlane treated his captive with the
utmost courtesy and consideration; and on the occasion
of the victorious feast after the battle, placed a crown
upon his head and a sceptre in his hand, promising that
he should return to the throne of his fathers with
greater glory than before.  But Bajazet died before his
generous conqueror could carry out his promises, and
Tamerlane, taking his place, demanded tribute of his
sons and of Manuel of Constantinople at the same time.
</p>

<p>
The two elder sons of Bajazet were now at variance
over the poor remains of his empire.  One of these
bought the aid of Manuel by surrendering the coast
of Thessaly and the seaports of the Black Sea, and
the Emperor was able to keep these just so long as the
war between the brothers continued to rage.  Even
after this had ended in the triumph over both of
Mohammed, Bajazet's youngest son, Manuel could
feel fairly safe, for of late years he had thrown in his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P270"></a>270}</span>
lot with Mohammed and was allowed to hold his
possessions in peace.
</p>

<p>
This period of civil war, was of course, the opportunity
for the Greek ruler to have driven out the Ottomans from
his former empire.  But this opportunity was lost as
so many others had been, and after Mohammed died in
1421, the empire was entirely surrendered to the
Ottomans.
</p>

<p>
Mohammed's successor, Amurath, is thus described
by one of his own historians.  "He was a just and valiant
prince, of a great soul, patient of labours, learned,
merciful, religious, charitable; a lover and encourager of the
studious, and of all who excelled in any art or science; a
good Emperor and a great general.
</p>

<p>
"No man obtained more or greater victories than
Amurath.  Under his reign the soldier was ever victorious,
the citizen rich and secure.  If he subdued any country,
his first care was to build mosques and caravanserais,
hospitals and colleges.  Every year he gave a thousand
pieces of gold to the sons of the Prophet, and sent two
thousands five hundred to the religious persons of Mecca,
Medina and Jerusalem."
</p>

<p>
Like the Emperor Charles V, a century later, this
"perfect prince" laid down the reins of empire at the
very height of his glory and "retired to the society of
saints and hermits," at Magnesia.  Twice he was recalled
to the field of action, first by an invasion of the
Hungarians, the second time by the insurrection of the
"haughty Janissaries "; and with these latter, now
humbled and trembling at his very look, the great
Amurath remained until his death.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the doomed city of Constantinople had been
further weakened by internal strife.  Hoping to get aid
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P271"></a>271}</span>
from the Pope, John Palæologus, the Emperor, had
publicly conformed to the Roman Church, with many of
his followers.  But the bulk of the inhabitants of
Constantinople utterly refused to throw over the ancient
faith of the Greek Church, and preferred to disown
their Emperor.  As one of them ominously muttered:
"Better the turban of the Turk in Constantinople than
the Pope's tiara."
</p>

<p>
Disappointed of his hopes of any practical aid from
Rome, John worked on in terrified silence while the
brave King of Poland and Hungary tried in vain to
drive back the triumphant Turks.  He died only three
years before the dreaded Amurath, and was succeeded
by his brother Constantine, bearer of the honoured
name of the founder of the city, but destined to be the
last Christian ruler of the Eastern Empire.
</p>

<p>
Before very long, Constantine found himself face to
face with the young Mohammed, the son of Amurath,
who was already surnamed the Conqueror.
</p>

<p>
The all-absorbing desire of Mohammed was the
possession of Constantinople, in order that it might be
made the capital of his own Empire.  Some pretence
therefore must be found for a rupture with his meek
vassal Constantine.  At that time there dwelt within
the city a certain Ottoman prince named Orkhan, much
given to plots and ambitions, on whose account the
Emperor was paid a considerable sum by Mohammed,
on condition that he was kept from doing any harm.
Very unwisely Constantine sent envoys to press for a
larger payment, and even went so far as to try to
blackmail the Sultan by hinting that Orkhan had the better
right to the throne.
</p>

<p>
The reply of Mohammed was a prompt order to his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P272"></a>272}</span>
engineers to construct a series of forts between
Constantinople and the Black Sea, and thus to begin
the siege by isolating the city from her port and
food supplies.  The actual excuse for warfare was
provided in an attack made by some Greek soldiers
on the Turks who were pulling down a beautiful old
church in order to use its stones for their fort.  The
Greeks were promptly cut to pieces, and when
Constantine dared to remonstrate, Mohammed at once
declared war.
</p>

<p>
In vain did the despairing Emperor seek for help from
the West.  Even Genoa and Venice were blind to the
approaching loss of all their Eastern trade, and Rome
could do little to help.  When the Emperor made a strong
appeal to his own subjects to rally to the protection of
their city, they listened in sullen silence to the words of
one who had renounced the faith of his ancestors and
conformed to the Church of Rome.  There was never
the smallest chance of holding out against the vigorous
young Sultan and his picked troops.
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1453 the actual siege began.
Mohammed made use of that gunpowder which was to
revolutionise all the ancient modes of warfare, and the
old walls of Constantinople shuddered and fell before the
shock.
</p>

<p>
The besieged had their guns too, but they did more
harm than good, for the walls were too narrow to hold
them and were so shaken by the concussion that these
weapons had to be abandoned.
</p>

<p>
Yet for a time, owing largely to the courage and spirit
of Constantine, the city not only held out, but succeeded
in sending five vessels into the midst of the Turkish
fleet, sinking and otherwise destroying all with which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P273"></a>273}</span>
they came into contact.  For allowing this to happen,
the Turkish admiral, in spite of his plea of an injured eye
as the cause of the mishap, was sentenced to receive a
hundred strokes from a golden rod in the presence of
the angry Sultan.
</p>

<p>
But this victory was quickly counterbalanced by
Mohammed, who had some of his vessels brought
overland across the neck that lies between the Bosphorus
and the Golden Horn, thus shutting out the city from the
sea on both sides.  After a siege of forty days the end
came on May 29, 1453.  A special effort was urged by
the Sultan in these words: "The city and the buildings
are mine, but I resign to you the captives and the spoil,
the treasures of gold and beauty; be rich and happy.
Many are the provinces of my Empire; the intrepid
soldier who first ascends the walls of Constantinople shall
be rewarded with the government of the fairest and
most wealthy; and my gratitude shall accumulate his
honours and fortunes above the measure of his own hopes."
</p>

<p>
The answer came loud and strong from every part of
the camp.
</p>

<p>
"Allah is great!  There is no God but Allah, and
Mohammed is His Prophet."
</p>

<p>
Within the city all was in gloom and despair.  The
Emperor was blamed for not surrendering earlier;
many said that the "repose and security of Turkish
servitude" were far preferable to this last stand for
freedom.
</p>

<p>
The unfortunate Constantine listened in silence, and
then went to the Cathedral of St Sophia, where he partook
of his last Sacrament.  Rising from a brief and troubled
rest at dawn, he mounted his horse to ride back to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P274"></a>274}</span>
breach in the falling walls.  His few faithful friends and
attendants pressed round the master who they knew
was going to his death.  Looking gravely down upon
them, "he prayed one and all to pardon him for any
offence that he might knowingly or unknowingly have
committed against any man."
</p>

<p>
The crowd answered with cries and lamentations as he
rode calmly to his fate.  "The distress and fall of the
last Constantine," says Gibbon, "are more glorious than
the long prosperity of the Byzantine Cæsars."
</p>

<p>
Standing in the gap made in the wall by the Gate of
St Romanus, the Emperor and his little band awaited the
rush of the Janissaries.  One by one his men fell behind
him and at his side, until he alone remained.
</p>

<p>
One more attack was made, and this time the infidels
swarmed right into the town, trampling the body of the
Emperor underfoot.  All that long and dreadful day the
wail of the captives ascended to the heavens, and when
a search was made among the dead, only the golden eagles
on his shoes identified the crushed and disfigured form of
him who once was Constantine, last of his race.
</p>

<p>
The last scene in the grim drama was played when
the Sultan came to the Church of St Sophia, and, riding
upon his magnificent war-horse, passed in through the
eastern door and bade the Mullah pronounce the formula
of the faith of Islam from the high pulpit.
</p>

<p>
"Allah is great!  There is no God but Allah, and
Mohammed is His Prophet!"
</p>

<p>
The words resounded through the aisles of the great
eastern church, as they had echoed first in the desert
of Arabia nearly nine hundred years before that day.
</p>

<p>
Through well-nigh nine centuries we have traced the
growth of Islam, and the part played by the Holy War
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P275"></a>275}</span>
in hindering its progress to the West; and, having
recorded this last and successful attempt of the
Mohammedans at establishing themselves in Europe,
we will bring our story to an end with one last glance
at the effect of this great movement upon Christendom.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br />
The Effect of the Crusades
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,<br />
  Till earth and sky stand presently at God's great Judgment Seat;<br />
  But there is neither East nor West, Border nor Breed nor Birth,<br />
  When two strong men stand face to face, though they come from the ends<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the earth.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RUDYARD KIPLING: Ballad of East and West.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The sacred fire of enthusiasm for the "Cause of
God" still flickered faintly in Europe during
the years that immediately preceded the fall of
Constantinople.  Our own Henry V., during his lifetime,
sent out a knight of Burgundy, Gilbert de Lannoy, to
see what chances there were of the success of a new
Crusade; and Henry's dying words showed that he had
not forgotten his design.  "Good Lord, Thou knowest
that mine intent had been, and yet is, if I may live, to
rebuild the walls of Jerusalem."
</p>

<p>
But with the fall of Constantinople, all further hope
of wresting the Holy Land from the infidel came to an
end.  Never again did a prince of the West set out to
recover those "holy fields," and to this day they are ruled
by the Sultan of Turkey.
</p>

<p>
It is said of Columbus that he had in mind the idea of
stirring up an Eastern War in the "Cause of God" before
there had dawned upon him the vision of that Western
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P277"></a>277}</span>
enterprise which was to open the gate to a new world.
And that religious zeal did not die with the Crusades is to
be seen in the constant stream of pilgrims to the Holy
Land which, for a hundred years, followed the final defeat
of Christendom, and which, suspended though it was
during the spiritual apathy of the eighteenth century,
has continued down to the present day.
</p>

<p>
But the Age of Warfare was over when Constantinople
fell, and with the dawn of that great awakening of thought
and literature which we call the Renaissance, men turned
away from bloodshed to the joys of discovery and
enterprise in a new world.
</p>

<p>
A little later, when the Wars of the Reformation broke
out, and Europe took up the sword anew, the whole
spirit of the Western world had changed.  The East had
lost its glamour, and the antagonism between religious
and political parties had waxed so hot in Christendom
that the old feud between Christian and pagan was
entirely laid aside.
</p>

<p>
Yet the Crusades, in spite of their apparent failure, had
done a great work.  First and foremost they had
succeeded in deferring the rule of the Turk in Europe, and
by the constant checks they offered to his progress, had
prevented him from conquering anything but the merest
fringe of the West.  The advantage of this, apart from
considerations of religion, will be seen at once if we
compare the condition of the subjects of the Sultan with
that of the more progressive of the Christian races
of Europe.
</p>

<p>
But the benefits conferred upon Europe by the Crusades
are by no means only of this negative character.  The
Saracen of the Middle Ages was a learned and cultured
gentleman, skilled in medicine, in music, and in various
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P278"></a>278}</span>
other sciences, and, generally speaking, as much superior
to the rough uneducated Crusader of the Western World
as he was to the savage Ottoman Turk.
</p>

<p>
Foes though they were in name, there was always a
certain amount of friendly intercourse between the
Crusaders and the Saracens, and the former were bound
to be affected in some degree by the civilisation of the
latter.  Sometimes a dark-faced "leech" would return
in the train of a Crusading baron to Europe, and there
would teach some of his mysteries of healing to the
rough-and-ready doctors of the West.
</p>

<p>
To the Arabs we owe our "Arabic" system of numbers,
used instead of the clumsy Roman figures, and the
knowledge of the decimal notation, by which nearly every
civilised country except our own reckons its money.
From Architecture to Geography, all those branches of
knowledge which distinguish the educated from the
uneducated mind, may be traced back to the keen and
subtle intelligence of the East.
</p>

<p>
Next perhaps in importance comes the opening up of
the East to the West for purposes of Commerce.  Many
a knightly Crusader thought it no shame to carry on
an extensive trade in the silks and spices of Palestine
in order to fill his coffers upon his return and that he
might be recompensed for the expenses of his undertaking.
The constant crossing and recrossing of the Mediterranean
soon set on foot a steady stream of commercial
enterprise between the seaports of Italy and those of
Syria, and the existence of a Latin Empire of
Constantinople impelled Venice, the main cause of its
establishment, to still closer communication with the
East.  To her, as "the Southern terminus of a great
land trade-route," was carried the produce of England,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P279"></a>279}</span>
Norway, Flanders, France and Germany as to a huge
market, and she distributed it throughout the Eastern
world, receiving in return the wealth of the latter to be
carried back to Europe.  It was only when the
discovery of America opened up an entirely new field of
enterprise that this great stream of commerce began to
diminish.
</p>

<p>
Another effect of the Crusades was upon the great
world of literature.  Such a unique event as a Holy War
was bound to inspire the writers of history even in the
days when such writers were rarely to be found.  William
of Tyre was only one amongst several chroniclers of the
First Crusade, and the story of the Crusades of later days
have been vividly told by Richard of Devizes, Villehardouin
and the Sire de Joinville, many of whose telling
descriptions have been quoted in the pages of this book.
</p>

<p>
It was but natural that the gallant adventures of the
Crusaders should form the theme of many of the epics
and <i>chansons</i> of Chivalry.  Charlemagne, Roland and
Bevis of Hampton may never have seen the Holy Land,
but they became the heroes of Crusading exploits
nevertheless; while Richard Lion-Heart and Godfrey of
Boulogne, actual leaders in the Holy War, became the
central figures of more or less impossible legendary
adventures.
</p>

<p>
Through all this stream of literature ran that quickening,
inspiring spirit of hope&mdash;perhaps the greatest gift
of the Crusades to a world which, in the years
between the Empire of Charlemagne and the Renaissance,
might easily have fallen into a deadened condition of
indifference and disruption.
</p>

<p>
This is scarcely the place to speak of the great unifying
effect upon Europe, nor of the influence of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P280"></a>280}</span>
movement upon the feudal conditions of the time; but
we have seen enough to know that the Western World
was decidedly the better, spiritually, mentally and
physically, for that gigantic failure which we know as
the Crusades.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
